See the \nDEVELOPMENT.md\n for code-documentation.\n\n\nRules\n\n\nRules are defined using a logical language.\nThe GUI provides a simple way of creating basic as well as complex Rules in a self-describing manner.\nMore complex rules can be written manually.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nRules must consist of at least 3 elements: An \nEntity\n, a \nCondition\n and a \nValue\n.\nRules can contain braces and \nGlues\n.\n\nEntities\n are provided as \n%\n-Noted pair of Table and Field. For Example: \n%ports.ifOperStatus\n.\n\nConditions\n can be any of:\n\n\n\n\nEquals \n=\n\n\nNot Equals \n!=\n\n\nLike \n~\n\n\nNot Like \n!~\n\n\nGreater \n\n\nGreater or Equal \n=\n\n\nSmaller \n\n\nSmaller or Equal \n=\n\n\n\n\nValues\n can be Entities or any single-quoted data.\n\nGlues\n can be either \n for \nAND\n or \n||\n for \nOR\n.\n\n\nNote\n: The difference between \nEquals\n and \nLike\n (and its negation) is that \nEquals\n does a strict comparison and \nLike\n allows the usage of RegExp.\nArithmetics are allowed as well.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nAlert when:\n\n\n\n\nDevice goes down: \n%devices.status != '1'\n\n\nAny port changes: \n%ports.ifOperStatus != 'up'\n\n\nRoot-directory gets too full: \n%storage.storage_descr = '/' \n %storage.storage_perc \n= '75'\n\n\nAny storage gets fuller than the 'warning': \n%storage.storage_perc \n= %storage_perc_warn\n\n\nIf device is a server and the used storage is above the warning level, but ignore /boot partitions: \n%storage.storage_perc \n %storage.storage_perc_warn \n %devices.type = \"server\" \n %storage.storage_descr !~ \"/boot\"\n\n\nVMware LAG is not using \"Source ip address hash\" load balancing: \n%devices.os = \"vmware\" \n %ports.ifType = \"ieee8023adLag\" \n %ports.ifDescr !~ \"Link Aggregation @, load balancing algorithm: Source ip address hash\"\n\n\nSyslog, authentication failure during the last 5m: \n%syslog.timestamp \n= %macros.past_5m \n %syslog.msg ~ \"@authentication failure@\"\n\n\nHigh memory usage: \n%macros.device_up = \"1\" \n %mempools.mempool_perc \n= \"90\" \n %mempools.mempool_descr = \"Virtual@\"\n\n\nHigh CPU usage(per core usage, not overall): \n%macros.device_up = \"1\" \n %processors.processor_usage \n= \"90\"\n\n\nHigh port usage, where description is not client \n ifType is not softwareLoopback: \n%macros.port_usage_perc \n= \"80\" \n %port.port_descr_type != \"client\" \n %ports.ifType != \"softwareLoopback\"\n\n\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\nYou can associate a rule to a procedure by giving the URL of the procedure when creating the rule. Only links like \"http://\" are supported, otherwise an error will be returned. Once configured, procedure can be opened from the Alert widget through the \"Open\" button, which can be shown/hidden from the widget configuration box.\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nTemplates can be assigned to a single or a group of rules.\nThey can contain any kind of text.\nThe template-parser understands \nif\n and \nforeach\n controls and replaces certain placeholders with information gathered about the alert.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\nControls:\n\n\n\n\nif-else (Else can be omitted):\n\n{if %placeholder == value}Some Text{else}Other Text{/if}\n\n\nforeach-loop:\n\n{foreach %placeholder}Key: %key\nbr/\nValue: %value{/foreach}\n\n\n\n\nPlaceholders:\n\n\n\n\nHostname of the Device: \n%hostname\n\n\nsysName of the Device: \n%sysName\n\n\nlocation of the Device: \n%location\n\n\nuptime of the Device (in seconds): \n%uptime\n\n\nshort uptime of the Device (28d 22h 30m 7s): \n%uptime_short\n\n\nlong uptime of the Device (28 days, 22h 30m 7s): \n%uptime_long\n\n\ndescription (purpose db field) of the Device: \n%description\n\n\nnotes of the Device: \n%notes\n\n\nTitle for the Alert: \n%title\n\n\nTime Elapsed, Only available on recovery (\n%state == 0\n): \n%elapsed\n\n\nAlert-ID: \n%id\n\n\nUnique-ID: \n%uid\n\n\nFaults, Only available on alert (\n%state != 0\n), must be iterated in a foreach (\n{foreach %faults}\n). Holds all available information about the Fault, accessible in the format \n%value.Column\n, for example: \n%value.ifDescr\n. Special field \n%value.string\n has most Identification-information (IDs, Names, Descrs) as single string, this is the equivalent of the default used.\n\n\nState: \n%state\n\n\nSeverity: \n%severity\n\n\nRule: \n%rule\n\n\nRule-Name: \n%name\n\n\nTimestamp: \n%timestamp\n\n\nTransport name: \n%transport\n\n\nContacts, must be iterated in a foreach, \n%key\n holds email and \n%value\n holds name: \n%contacts\n\n\n\n\nPlaceholders can be used within the subjects for templates as well although %faults is most likely going to be worthless.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Placeholder names which are contained within another need to be ordered correctly. As an example:\n\n\n\n\nLimit: %value.sensor_limit / %value.sensor_limit_low\n\n\n\n\nShould be done as:\n\n\nLimit: %value.sensor_limit_low / %value.sensor_limit\n\n\n\n\nThe Default Template is a 'one-size-fit-all'. We highly recommend defining own templates for your rules to include more specific information.\nTemplates can be matched against several rules.\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nDefault Template:\n\n\n%title\\r\\n\nSeverity: %severity\\r\\n\n{if %state == 0}Time elapsed: %elapsed\\r\\n{/if}\nTimestamp: %timestamp\\r\\n\nUnique-ID: %uid\\r\\n\nRule: {if %name}%name{else}%rule{/if}\\r\\n\n{if %faults}Faults:\\r\\n\n{foreach %faults}  #%key: %value.string\\r\\n{/foreach}{/if}\nAlert sent to: {foreach %contacts}%value \n%key\n {/foreach}\n\n\n\n\nConditional formatting example, will display a link to the host in email or just the hostname in any other transport:\n\n\n{if %transport == mail}\na href=\nhttps://my.librenms.install/device/device=%hostname/\n%hostname\n/a\n{else}%hostname{/if}\n\n\n\n\nNote the use of double-quotes.  Single quotes (\n'\n) in templates will be escaped (replaced with \n\\'\n) in the output and should therefore be avoided.\n\n\nIncluded\n\n\nWe include a few templates for you to use, these are specific to the type of alert rules you are creating. For example if you create a rule that would alert on BGP sessions then you can \nassign the BGP template to this rule to provide more information.\n\n\nThe included templates are:\n\n\n\n\nBGP Sessions\n\n\nPorts\n\n\nTemperature\n\n\n\n\nTransports\n\n\nTransports are located within \n$config['install_dir']/includes/alerts/transports.*.php\n and defined as well as configured via \n$config['alert']['transports']['Example'] = 'Some Options'\n.\n\n\nContacts will be gathered automatically and passed to the configured transports.\nBy default the Contacts will be only gathered when the alert triggers and will ignore future changes in contacts for the incident. If you want contacts to be re-gathered before each dispatch, please set \n$config['alert']['fixed-contacts'] = false;\n in your config.php.\n\n\nThe contacts will always include the \nSysContact\n defined in the Device's SNMP configuration and also every LibreNMS-User that has at least \nread\n-permissions on the entity that is to be alerted.\nAt the moment LibreNMS only supports Port or Device permissions.\nYou can exclude the \nSysContact\n by setting:\n\n\n$config['alert']['syscontact'] = false;\n\n\n\n\nTo include users that have \nGlobal-Read\n or \nAdministrator\n permissions it is required to add these additions to the \nconfig.php\n respectively:\n\n\n$config['alert']['globals'] = true; //Include Global-Read into alert-contacts\n$config['alert']['admins']  = true; //Include Administrators into alert-contacts\n\n\n\n\nE-Mail\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure these options within the WebUI now, please avoid setting these options within config.php\n\n\n\n\nFor all but the default contact, we support setting multiple email addresses separated by a comma. So you can \nset the devices sysContact, override the sysContact or have your users emails set like:\n\n\nemail@domain.com, alerting@domain.com\n\n\nE-Mail transport is enabled with adding the following to your \nconfig.php\n:\n~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['mail'] = true;\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nThe E-Mail transports uses the same email-configuration like the rest of LibreNMS.\nAs a small reminder, here is it's configuration directives including defaults:\n~~\n\n\n$config['email_backend']                   = 'mail';               // Mail backend. Allowed: \nmail\n (PHP's built-in), \nsendmail\n, \nsmtp\n.\n$config['email_from']                      = NULL;                 // Mail from. Default: \nProjectName\n \nprojectid@`hostname`\n\n$config['email_user']                      = $config['project_id'];\n$config['email_sendmail_path']             = '/usr/sbin/sendmail'; // The location of the sendmail program.\n$config['email_html']                      = FALSE;                // Whether to send HTML email as opposed to plaintext\n$config['email_smtp_host']                 = 'localhost';          // Outgoing SMTP server name.\n$config['email_smtp_port']                 = 25;                   // The port to connect.\n$config['email_smtp_timeout']              = 10;                   // SMTP connection timeout in seconds.\n$config['email_smtp_secure']               = NULL;                 // Enable encryption. Use 'tls' or 'ssl'\n$config['email_smtp_auth']                 = FALSE;                // Whether or not to use SMTP authentication.\n$config['email_smtp_username']             = NULL;                 // SMTP username.\n$config['email_smtp_password']             = NULL;                 // Password for SMTP authentication.\n\n$config['alert']['default_only']           = false;                //Only issue to default_mail\n$config['alert']['default_mail']           = '';                   //Default email\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nAPI\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure these options within the WebUI now, please avoid setting these options within config.php\n\n\n\n\nAPI transports definitions are a bit more complex than the E-Mail configuration.\nThe basis for configuration is \n$config['alert']['transports']['api'][METHOD]\n where \nMETHOD\n can be \nget\n,\npost\n or \nput\n.\nThis basis has to contain an array with URLs of each API to call.\nThe URL can have the same placeholders as defined in the \nTemplate-Syntax\n.\nIf the \nMETHOD\n is \nget\n, all placeholders will be URL-Encoded.\nThe API transport uses cURL to call the APIs, therefore you might need to install \nphp5-curl\n or similar in order to make it work.\n\nNote\n: it is highly recommended to define own \nTemplates\n when you want to use the API transport. The default template might exceed URL-length for GET requests and therefore cause all sorts of errors.\n\n\nExample:\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['api']['get'][] = \nhttps://api.thirdparti.es/issue?apikey=abcdefg\nsubject=%title\n;\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nNagios Compatible\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure these options within the WebUI now, please avoid setting these options within config.php\n\n\n\n\nThe nagios transport will feed a FIFO at the defined location with the same format that nagios would.\nThis allows you to use other Alerting-Systems to work with LibreNMS, for example \nFlapjack\n.\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['nagios'] = \n/path/to/my.fifo\n; //Flapjack expects it to be at '/var/cache/nagios3/event_stream.fifo'\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nIRC\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure these options within the WebUI now, please avoid setting these options within config.php\n\n\n\n\nThe IRC transports only works together with the LibreNMS IRC-Bot.\nConfiguration of the LibreNMS IRC-Bot is described \nhere\n.\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['irc'] = true;\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nSlack\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure these options within the WebUI now, please avoid setting these options within config.php\n\n\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\nThe Slack transport will POST the alert message to your Slack Incoming WebHook using the \nattachments\n option, you are able to specify multiple webhooks along with the relevant options to go with it. Simple html tags are stripped from the message. All options are optional, the only required value is for url, without this then no call to Slack will be made. Below is an example of how to send alerts to two channels with different customised options: \n\n\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['slack'][] = array('url' =\n \nhttps://hooks.slack.com/services/A12B34CDE/F56GH78JK/L901LmNopqrSTUVw2w3XYZAB4C\n, 'channel' =\n '#Alerting');\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['slack'][] = array('url' =\n \nhttps://hooks.slack.com/services/A12B34CDE/F56GH78JK/L901LmNopqrSTUVw2w3XYZAB4C\n, 'channel' =\n '@john', 'username' =\n 'LibreNMS', 'icon_emoji' =\n ':ghost:');\n\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nRocket.chat\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\nThe Rocket.chat transport will POST the alert message to your Rocket.chat Incoming WebHook using the \nattachments\n option, you are able to specify multiple webhooks along with the relevant options to go with it. Simple html tags are stripped from the message. All options are optional, the only required value is for url, without this then no call to Rocket.chat will be made. Below is an example of how to send alerts to two channels with different customised options:\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['rocket'][] = array('url' =\n \nhttps://rocket.url/api/v1/chat.postMessage\n, 'channel' =\n '#Alerting');\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['rocket'][] = array('url' =\n \nhttps://rocket.url/api/v1/chat.postMessage\n, 'channel' =\n '@john', 'username' =\n 'LibreNMS', 'icon_emoji' =\n ':ghost:');\n\n\n\n\n\nHipChat\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure these options within the WebUI now, please avoid setting these options within config.php\n\n\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\nThe HipChat transport requires the following:\n\n\nroom_id\n = HipChat Room ID\n\n\nurl\n = HipChat API URL+API Key\n\n\nfrom\n = The name that will be displayed\n\n\nThe HipChat transport makes the following optional:\n\n\ncolor\n = Any of HipChat's supported message colors\n\n\nmessage_format\n = Any of HipChat's supported message formats\n\n\nnotify\n = 0 or 1\n\n\nSee the HipChat API Documentation for\n\nrooms/message\n\nfor details on acceptable values.\n\n\n\n\nYou may notice that the link points at the \"deprecated\" v1 API.  This is\nbecause the v2 API is still in beta.\n\n\n\n\nBelow are two examples of sending messages to a HipChat room.\n\n\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['hipchat'][] = array(\nurl\n =\n \nhttps://api.hipchat.com/v1/rooms/message?auth_token=9109jawregoaih\n,\n                                                    \nroom_id\n =\n \n1234567\n,\n                                                    \nfrom\n =\n \nLibreNMS\n);\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['hipchat'][] = array(\nurl\n =\n \nhttps://api.hipchat.com/v1/rooms/message?auth_token=109jawregoaihj\n,\n                                                    \nroom_id\n =\n \n7654321\n,\n                                                    \nfrom\n =\n \nLibreNMS\n,\n                                                    \ncolor\n =\n \nred\n,\n                                                    \nnotify\n =\n 1,\n                                                    \nmessage_format\n =\n \ntext\n);\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\n\n\nNote: The default message format for HipChat messages is HTML.  It is\nrecommended that you specify the \ntext\n message format to prevent unexpected\nresults, such as HipChat attempting to interpret angled brackets (\n and\n\n).\n\n\n\n\nPagerDuty\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure these options within the WebUI now, please avoid setting these options within config.php\n\n\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\nEnabling PagerDuty transports is almost as easy as enabling email-transports.\n\n\nAll you need is to create a Service with type Generic API on your PagerDuty dashboard.\n\n\nNow copy your API-Key from the newly created Service and setup the transport like:\n\n\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['pagerduty'] = 'MYAPIKEYGOESHERE';\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nThat's it!\n\n\nNote\n: Currently ACK notifications are not transported to PagerDuty, This is going to be fixed within the next major version (version by date of writing: 2015.05)\n\n\nPushover\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\nEnabling Pushover support is fairly easy, there are only two required parameters.\n\n\nFirstly you need to create a new Application (called LibreNMS, for example) in your account on the Pushover website (https://pushover.net/apps)\n\n\nNow copy your API Token/Key from the newly created Application and setup the transport in your config.php like:\n\n\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['pushover'][] = array(\n                                                    \nappkey\n =\n 'APPLICATIONAPIKEYGOESHERE',\n                                                    \nuserkey\n =\n 'USERKEYGOESHERE',\n                                                    );\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nTo modify the Critical alert sound, add the 'sound_critical' parameter, example:\n\n\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['pushover'][] = array(\n                                                    \nappkey\n =\n 'APPLICATIONAPIKEYGOESHERE',\n                                                    \nuserkey\n =\n 'USERKEYGOESHERE',\n                                                    \nsound_critical\n =\n 'siren',\n                                                    );\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nBoxcar\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\nEnabling Boxcar support is super easy.\nCopy your access token from the Boxcar app or from the Boxcar.io website and setup the transport in your config.php like:\n\n\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['boxcar'][] = array(\n                                                    \naccess_token\n =\n 'ACCESSTOKENGOESHERE',\n                                                    );\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nTo modify the Critical alert sound, add the 'sound_critical' parameter, example:\n\n\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['boxcar'][] = array(\n                                                    \naccess_token\n =\n 'ACCESSTOKENGOESHERE',\n                                                    \nsound_critical\n =\n 'detonator-charge',\n                                                    );\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\n\n\nThank you to \nsnis\n for these instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst you must create a telegram account and add BotFather to you list. To do this click on the following url: https://telegram.me/botfather\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a new bot with the command \"/newbot\" BotFather is then asking for a username and a normal name. After that your bot is created and you get a HTTP token. (for more options for your bot type \"/help\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your bot to telegram with the following url: \nhttp://telegram.me/\nbotname\n and send some text to the bot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow copy your token code and go to the following page in chrome: \nhttps://api.telegram.org/bot\ntokencode\n/getUpdates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou see a json code with the message you sent to the bot. Copy the Chat id. In this example that is \u201c-9787468\u201d\n   \n\"message\":{\"message_id\":7,\"from\":\"id\":656556,\"first_name\":\"Joo\",\"last_name\":\"Doo\",\"username\":\"JohnDoo\"},\"chat\":{\"id\":-9787468,\"title\":\"Telegram Group\"},\"date\":1435216924,\"text\":\"Hi\"}}]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow create a new \"Telegram transport\" in LibreNMS (Global Settings -\n Alerting Settings -\n Telegram transport).\nClick on 'Add Telegram config' and put your chat id and token into the relevant box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPushbullet\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\nEnabling Pushbullet is a piece of cake.\nGet your Access Token from your Pushbullet's settings page and set it in your config like:\n\n\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['pushbullet'] = 'MYFANCYACCESSTOKEN';\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nClickatell\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\nClickatell provides a REST-API requiring an Authorization-Token and at least one Cellphone number.\nPlease consult Clickatell's documentation regarding number formatting.\nHere an example using 3 numbers, any amount of numbers is supported:\n\n\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['clickatell']['token'] = 'MYFANCYACCESSTOKEN';\n$config['alert']['transports']['clickatell']['to'][]  = '+1234567890';\n$config['alert']['transports']['clickatell']['to'][]  = '+1234567891';\n$config['alert']['transports']['clickatell']['to'][]  = '+1234567892';\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nPlaySMS\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\nPlaySMS is an open source SMS-Gateway that can be used via their HTTP-API using a Username and WebService-Token.\nPlease consult PlaySMS's documentation regarding number formatting.\nHere an example using 3 numbers, any amount of numbers is supported:\n\n\n~~\n\n\n$config['alert']['transports']['playsms']['url']   = 'https://localhost/index.php?app=ws';\n$config['alert']['transports']['playsms']['user']  = 'user1';\n$config['alert']['transports']['playsms']['token'] = 'MYFANCYACCESSTOKEN';\n$config['alert']['transports']['playsms']['from']  = '+1234567892'; //Optional\n$config['alert']['transports']['playsms']['to'][]  = '+1234567890';\n$config['alert']['transports']['playsms']['to'][]  = '+1234567891';\n\n\n\n\n~~\n\n\nVictorOps\n\n\nUsing a proxy?\n\n\nVictorOps provide a webHook url to make integration extremely simple. To get the URL required login to your VictorOps account and go to:\n\n\nSettings -\n Integrations -\n REST Endpoint -\n Enable Integration.\n\n\nThe URL provided will have $routing_key at the end, you need to change this to something that is unique to the system sending the alerts such as librenms.

This is most likely to happen when the recidive is in use.\n\n\nIf you have more than a few jails configured, you may need to use caching as each jail needs to be polled and fail2ban-client can't do so in a timely manner for than a few.

If you want to monitor multiple pools, this won't do it.\n\n\nPostfix\n\n\nSNMP Extend\n\n\n1: Copy the shell script, postfix-queues, to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices) (wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/postfix-queues -O /etc/snmp/postfix-queues)\n\n\n2: Copy the Perl script, postfixdetailed, to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices) (wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/postfixdetailed -O /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed)\n\n\n3: Make the scripts executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed /etc/snmp/postfix-queues)\n\n\n4: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:\n\n\nextend mailq /etc/snmp/postfix-queues\nextend postfixdetailed /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed\n\n\n\n\n5: Restart snmpd.\n\n\n6: Install pflogsumm for your OS.\n\n\n7: Make sure the cache file in /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed is some place that snmpd can write too. This file is used for tracking changes between various values between each time it is called by snmpd. Also make sure the path for pflogsumm is correct.\n\n\n8: Run /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed to create the initial cache file so you don't end up with some crazy initial starting value.\nPlease note that each time /etc/snmp/postfixdetailed is ran, the cache file is updated, so if this happens in between LibreNMS doing it then the values will be thrown off for that polling period.\n\n\nPostgres\n\n\nSNMP Extend\n\n\n1: Copy the shell script, postgres, to the desired host (the host must be added to LibreNMS devices) (wget https://github.com/librenms/librenms-agent/raw/master/snmp/postgres -O /etc/snmp/postgres)\n\n\n2: Make the script executable (chmod +x /etc/snmp/postgres)\n\n\n3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add:\n\n\nextend postgres /etc/snmp/postgres\n\n\n\n\n4: Restart snmpd on your host\n\n\n5: Install the Nagios check check_postgres.pl on your system.\n\n\n6: Verify the path to check_postgres.pl in /etc/snmp/postgres is correct.\n\n\n7: If you wish it to ignore the database postgres for totalling up the stats, set ignorePG to 1(the default) in /etc/snmp/postgres. If you are using netdata or the like, you may wish to set this or otherwise that total will be very skewed on systems with light or moderate usage.\n\n\nPowerDNS\n\n\nAn authoritative DNS server: https://www.powerdns.com/auth.html\n\n\nSNMP Extend\n\n\nAgent\n\n\nInstall the agent\n on this device if it isn't already and copy the \npowerdns\n script to \n/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/\n\n\nPowerDNS Recursor\n\n\nA recursive DNS server: https://www.powerdns.com/recursor.html\n\n\nDirect\n\n\nThe LibreNMS polling host must be able to connect to port 8082 on the monitored device.\nThe web-server must be enabled, see the Recursor docs: https://doc.powerdns.com/md/recursor/settings/#webserver\n\n\nVariables\n\n\n$config['apps']['powerdns-recursor']['api-key']\n required, this is defined in the Recursor config\n\n$config['apps']['powerdns-recursor']['port']\n numeric, defines the port to connect to PowerDNS Recursor on.

So if the script is located at /etc/snmp/smart, the config file will be /etc/snmp/smart.config. Alternatively you can also specific a config via -c.\n\n\nAnything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables is $variable=$value. Empty lines are ignored. Spaces and tabes at either the start or end of a line are ignored. Any line with out a = or # are treated as a disk.\n\n\n#This is a comment\ncache=/var/cache/smart\nsmartctl=/usr/bin/env smartctl\nada0\nada1\n\n\n\n\nThe variables are as below.\n\n\ncache = The path to the cache file to use. Default: /var/cache/smart\nsmartctl = The path to use for smartctl. Default: /usr/bin/env smartctl\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to guess at the configuration, call it with -g and it will print out what it thinks\nit should be. This will result in a usable config, but may miss some less common disk devices.\n\n\n5: Restart snmpd on your host\n\n\nIf you have a large number of more than one or two disks on a system, you should consider adding this to cron.

To assist with this several Alerting Macro's have been created:\n\n\n\n\n%macro.component_normal\n - A component that is not disabled or ignored and in a Normal state.\n\n\n%macro.component_warning\n - A component that is not disabled or ignored and NOT in a Warning state.\n\n\n%macro.component_critical\n - A component that is not disabled or ignored and NOT in a Critical state.\n\n\n\n\nTo raise alerts for components, the following rules could be created:\n\n\n\n\n%macros.component_critical = \"1\"\n - To alert on all Critical components\n\n\n%macros.component_critical = \"1\" \n %component.type = \"\nType of Component\n\"\n - To alert on all Critical components of a particular type.\n\n\n\n\nIf there is a particular component you would like excluded from alerting, simply set the ignore field to 1.\n\n\nThe data that is written to each alert when it is raised is in the following format:\n\n\nCOMPONENT_TYPE - LABEL - ERROR\n\n\nExample Code\n\n\nTo see an example of how the component module can used, please see the following modules:\n\n\n\n\nCisco CBQoS\n\n\nincludes/discovery/cisco-cbqos.inc.php\n\n\nincludes/polling/cisco-cbqos.inc.php\n\n\nhtml/includes/graphs/device/cbqos_traffic.inc.php\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCisco OTV\n\n\nincludes/discovery/cisco-otv.inc.php\n\n\nincludes/polling/cisco-otv.inc.php\n\n\nhtml/includes/graphs/device/cisco-otv-mac.inc.php\n\n\nhtml/pages/routing/cisco-otv.inc.php",

If you are ensure of what the entity is you want then have a browse around inside MySQL using \nshow tables\n and \ndesc \ntablename\n.\n\n\nAs a working example and a common question, let's assume you want to group devices by hostname. If you hostname format is dcX.[devicetype].example.com. You would use the pattern\n\ndevices.hostname\n. Select the condition which in this case would be \nLike\n and then enter \ndc1\\..*\\.example.com\n.

If however you want to build a group based on multiple patterns then you can build a SQL like\nquery using And / Or. As an example, we want to base our group on the devices hostname AND it's type.

To pin a device to a poller, set it to a value greater than 0 and set the same value in the poller's config with \n$config['distributed_poller_group']\n. One can also specify a comma separated string of poller groups in $config['distributed_poller_group'].  The poller will then poll devices from any of the groups listed.  If new devices get added from the poller they will be assigned to the first poller group in the list unless the group is specified when adding the device.\n\n\nA standard configuration for a distributed poller would look like:\n\n\n// Distributed Poller-Settings\n$config['distributed_poller']                            = true;\n$config['distributed_poller_name']                       = file_get_contents('/proc/sys/kernel/hostname');\n$config['distributed_poller_group']                      = 0;\n$config['distributed_poller_memcached_host']             = 'example.net';\n$config['distributed_poller_memcached_port']             = '11211';\n\n\n\n\nExample Setup\n\n\nBelow is an example setup based on a real deployment which at the time of writing covers over 2,500 devices and 50,000 ports. The setup is running within an OpenStack environment with some commodity hardware for remote pollers. Here's a diagram of how you can scale LibreNMS out:\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nHow you setup the distribution is entirely up to you, you can choose to host the majority of the required services on a single virtual machine or server and then a poller to actually query the devices being monitored all the way through to having a dedicated server for each of the individual roles. Below are notes on what you need to consider both from the software layer but also connectivity.\n\n\nWeb / API Layer\n\n\nThis is typically Apache but we have setup guides for both Nginx and Lighttpd which should work perfectly fine. There is nothing unique about the role this service is providing except that if you are adding devices from this layer then the web service will need to be able to connect to the end device via SNMP and perform an ICMP test.\n\n\nIt is advisable to run RRDCached within this setup so that you don't need to share the rrd folder via a remote file share such as NFS. The web service can then generate rrd graphs via RRDCached. If RRDCached isn't an option then you can mount the rrd directory to read the RRD files directly.\n\n\nDatabase Server\n\n\nMySQL / MariaDB - At the moment these are the only database servers that are supported, work is being done to ensure MySQL Strict mode is also supported but this should be considered to be incomplete still and therefor disabled.\n\n\nThe pollers, web and API layers should all be able to access the database server directly.\n\n\nRRD Storage\n\n\nCentral storage should be provided so all RRD files can be read from and written to in one location. As suggested above, it's recommended that RRD Cached is configured and used.\n\n\nFor this example, we are running RRDCached to allow all pollers and web/api servers to read/write to the rrd files with the rrd directory also exported by NFS for simple access and maintenance.\n\n\nMemcache\n\n\nMemcache is required for the distributed pollers to be able to register to a central location and record what devices are polled. Memcache can run from any of the servers so long as it is accessible by all pollers.\n\n\nPollers\n\n\nPollers can be installed and run from anywhere, the only requirements are:\n\n\nThey can access the Memcache instance\nThey can create RRD files via some method such as a shared filesystem or RRDTool \n=1.5.5\nThey can access the MySQL server\n\n\nYou can either assign pollers into groups and set a poller group against certain devices, this will mean that those devices will only be processed by certain pollers (default poller group is 0) or you can assign all pollers to the default poller group for them to process any and all devices.\n\n\nThis will provide the ability to have a single poller behind a NAT firewall monitor internal devices and report back to your central system. You will then be able to monitor those devices from the Web UI as normal.\n\n\nAnother benefit to this is that you can provide N+x pollers, i.e if you know that you require three pollers to process all devices within 300 seconds then adding a 4th poller will mean that should any one single poller fail then the remaining three will complete polling in time. You could also use this to take a poller out of service for maintenance, i.e OS updates and software updates.\n\n\nIt is extremely advisable to either run a central recursive dns server such as pdns-recursor and have all of your pollers use this or install a recursive dns server on each poller - the volume of DNS requests on large installs can be significant and will slow polling down enough to cause issues with a large number of devices.\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\nIt's not necessary to run discovery services on all pollers. In fact, you should only run one discovery process per poller group. Designate a single poller to run discovery (or a separate server if required).\n\n\nConfig sample\n\n\nThe following config is taken from a live setup which consists of a Web server, DB server, RRDCached server and 3 pollers.\n\n\nWeb Server:\nRunning Apache and an install of LibreNMS in /opt/librenms\n - config.php\n\n\n$config['distributed_poller'] = true;\n$config['rrdcached']    = \nexample.com:42217\n;\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Server:\nRunning Memcache and MariaDB\n - Memcache\n\n\nUbuntu (/etc/memcached.conf)\n\n\n-d\n-m 64\n-p 11211\n-u memcache\n-l ip.ip.ip.ip\n\n\n\n\nRRDCached Server:\nRunning RRDCached\n  - RRDCached\n\n\nUbuntu (/etc/default/rrdcached)\n\n\nOPTS=\n-l 0:42217\n\nOPTS=\n$OPTS -j /var/lib/rrdcached/journal/ -F\n\nOPTS=\n$OPTS -b /opt/librenms/rrd -B\n\nOPTS=\n$OPTS -w 1800 -z 900\n\n\n\n\n\nPoller 1:\nRunning an install of LibreNMS in /opt/librenms\n\n\nconfig.php\n\n\n$config['distributed_poller_name']           = file_get_contents('/etc/hostname');\n$config['distributed_poller_group']          = '0';\n$config['distributed_poller_memcached_host'] = \nexample.com\n;\n$config['distributed_poller_memcached_port'] = 11211;\n$config['distributed_poller_host']           = \nexample.com\n;\n$config['distributed_poller_port']           = 11211;\n$config['distributed_poller']                = true;\n$config['rrdcached']                         = \nexample.com:42217\n;\n$config['update']                            = 0;\n\n\n\n\n/etc/cron.d/librenms\n\nRuns discovery and polling for group 0, daily.sh to deal with notifications and DB cleanup and alerts.\n\n\n33  */6 * * * librenms /opt/librenms/discovery.php -h all \n /dev/null 2\n1\n*/5 *   * * * librenms /opt/librenms/discovery.php -h new \n /dev/null 2\n1\n*/5 *   * * * librenms /opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 24 \n /opt/librenms/logs/wrapper.log\n15  0   * * * librenms /opt/librenms/daily.sh \n /dev/null 2\n1\n*   *   * * * librenms /opt/librenms/alerts.php \n /dev/null 2\n1\n\n\n\n\nPoller 2:\nRunning an install of LibreNMS in /opt/librenms\n\n\nconfig.php\n\n\n$config['distributed_poller_name']           = file_get_contents('/etc/hostname');\n$config['distributed_poller_group']          = '0';\n$config['distributed_poller_memcached_host'] = \nexample.com\n;\n$config['distributed_poller_memcached_port'] = 11211;\n$config['distributed_poller_host']           = \nexample.com\n;\n$config['distributed_poller_port']           = 11211;\n$config['distributed_poller']                = true;\n$config['rrdcached']                         = \nexample.com:42217\n;\n$config['update']                            = 0;\n\n\n\n\n/etc/cron.d/librenms\n\nRuns billing as well as polling for group 0.\n\n\n*/5 * * * * librenms /opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 24 \n /opt/librenms/logs/wrapper.log\n*/5 * * * * librenms /opt/librenms/poll-billing.php \n /dev/null 2\n1\n01  * * * * librenms /opt/librenms/billing-calculate.php \n /dev/null 2\n1\n\n\n\n\nPoller 3:\nRunning an install of LibreNMS in /opt/librenms\n\n\nconfig.php\n\n\n$config['distributed_poller_name']           = file_get_contents('/etc/hostname');\n$config['distributed_poller_group']          = '2,3';\n$config['distributed_poller_memcached_host'] = \nexample.com\n;\n$config['distributed_poller_memcached_port'] = 11211;\n$config['distributed_poller_host']           = \nexample.com\n;\n$config['distributed_poller_port']           = 11211;\n$config['distributed_poller']                = true;\n$config['rrdcached']                         = \nexample.com:42217\n;\n$config['update']                            = 0;\n\n\n\n\n/etc/cron.d/librenms\n\nRuns discovery and polling for groups 2 and 3.\n\n\n33  */6 * * * librenms /opt/librenms/discovery.php -h all \n /dev/null 2\n1\n*/5 *   * * * librenms /opt/librenms/discovery.php -h new \n /dev/null 2\n1\n*/5 *   * * * librenms /opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 16 \n /opt/librenms/logs/wrapper.log",

Feel free to\noffer corrections/suggestions via pull requests or email.\n\n\nPaul Gear \n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThis is the 2nd experimental release of MIB polling.  If you used the 1st\nrelease, you MUST perform a data conversion of the MIB-based polling files\nusing the script \ncontrib/convert-mib-graphs.sh\n.  Failure to do so will\nresult in your data collection silently stopping.\n\n\nMIB-based polling is disabled by default; you must set\n    \n$config['poller_modules']['mib'] = 1;\n\nin \nconfig.php\n to enable it.\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\nMIB-based polling results in the creation of a separate RRD file for each\ndevice-MIB-OID-index combination encountered by LibreNMS.  Thus it can cause\nyour disk space requirements to grow enormously and rapidly.  As an example,\nenabling MIB-based polling on my test Ruckus ZD1000 wireless controller with\none (1) AP and one (1) user on that AP resulted in a 5 MB increase in RRD\nspace usage for that device.  Each RRD file is around 125 KB in size (on\nx64-64 systems) and is pre-allocated, so after the first discovery and poller\nrun of each device with MIB-based polling enabled, disk space should be stable.\nHowever, monitoring disk usage is your responsibility.  (The good news: you\ncan do this with LibreNMS. :-)\n\n\nUnless you are running LibreNMS on a powerful system with pure SSD for RRD\nstorage, it is strongly recommended that you enable rrdcached and ensure it is\nworking \nbefore\n enabling MIB-based polling.\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nThe components involved in MIB-based polling are:\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOS discovery determines whether there are MIBs which should be polled.  If\n    so, they are registered in the \ndevice_mibs\n association table as relevant\n    to that device.  MIB associations for each device can be viewed at:\n    http://your.librenms.server/device/device=XXXX/tab=mib/\n    All MIBs used by MIB-based polling may be viewed at:\n    http://your.librenms.server/mibs/\n    All device associations created by MIB-based polling may be viewed at:\n    http://your.librenms.server/mib_assoc/ (Devices -\n MIB associations)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, all devices are checked for a MIB matching their sysObjectID.\n    If there is a matching MIB available, it is automatically included.\n    The sysObjectID for each device is now displayed on the overview page:\n    http://your.librenms.server/device/device=XXXX/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the above means that no MIB-based polling will occur until the\n    devices in question are rediscovered.  If you want to begin MIB-based\n    polling immediately, you must force rediscovery from the web UI, or run it\n    from the CLI using \n./discovery.php -h HOSTNAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring discovery, relevant MIBs are parsed using \nsnmptranslate\n, and the\n    data returned is used to populate a database which guides the poller in\n    what to store.  At the moment, only OIDs of INTEGER, Integer32, Gauge32,\n    Unsigned32, Counter32, and Counter64 data types are parsed, and negative\n    values are untested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevices may be excluded from MIB polling by changing the setting in the\n    device edit screen:\n    http://your.librenms.server/device/device=XXXX/tab=edit/section=modules/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring polling the MIB associations for the device are looked up, and the\n    MIB is polled for current values.  You can see the values which LibreNMS\n    has retrieved from the MIB poller in the \"Device MIB values\" section of\n    http://your.librenms.server/device/device=XXXX/tab=mib/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the latest poll is saved in the table \ndevice_oids\n, and RRD\n    files are saved in the relevant device directory as\n    mibName-oidName-index.rrd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphing\n\n\n\n\nFor each graph type defined in the database, a graph will appear in:\n    http://your.librenms.server/device/device=XXXX/tab=graphs/group=mib/\n\n\nMIB graphs are generated generically by\n    \nhtml/includes/graphs/device/mib.inc.php\n\n    There is presently no customisation of graphs available.\n\n\nIf there is only one index under a given OID, it is displayed as a normal\n    line graph; if there multiple OIDs, they are displayed as a stacked graph.\n    At the moment, all indices are placed in the same graph.  This is\n    non-optimal for, e.g., wifi controllers with hundreds of APs attached.\n\n\n\n\nAlerting\n\n\nThere is no specific support for alerting in the MIB-based polling engine, but\nthe data it collects may be used in alerts.  Here's an example of an alert\nwhich detects when a Ruckus wireless controller reports meshing disabled on an\naccess point:\n    http://libertysys.com.au/imagebin/3btw98DR.png\n\n\nAdding/testing other device types\n\n\nOne of the goals of this work is to help take out the heavy lifting of adding\nnew device types.  Even if you want fully-customised graphs or tables, you can\nstill use the MIB-based poller to make it easy to gather the data you want to\ngraph.\n\n\nHow to add a new device MIB\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the manufacturer's MIB is present in the mibs directory.  If you\n    plan to submit your work to LibreNMS, make sure you attribute the source\n    of the MIB, including the exact download URL if possible, or explicit\n    instructions about how to obtain it.\n\n\nCheck that \nsnmptranslate -Ts -M mibs -m MODULE | grep mibName\n produces\n    a named list of OIDs.  See the comments on \nsnmp_mib_walk()\n in\n    \nincludes/snmp.inc.php\n for an example.\n\n\nCheck that \nsnmptranslate -Td -On -M mibs -m MODULE MODULE::mibName\n\n    produces a parsed description of the OID values.  An example can be\n    found in the comments for \nsnmp_mib_parse()\n in \nincludes/snmp.inc.php\n.\n\n\nGet the \nsysObjectID\n from a device, for example:\n    \nsnmpget -v2c -c public -OUsb -m SNMPv2-MIB -M /opt/librenms/mibs -t 30 hostname sysObjectID.0\n\n\nEnsure \nsnmptranslate -m all -M /opt/librenms/mibs OID 2\n/dev/null\n\n    (where OID is the value returned for sysObjectID above) results in a\n    valid name for the MIB.  See the comments for \nsnmp_translate()\n in\n    \nincludes/snmp.inc.php\n for an example.  If this step fails, it means\n    there is something wrong with the MIB and \nnet-snmp\n cannot parse it.\n\n\nAdd any additional MIBs you wish to poll for specific device types to\n    \nincludes/discovery/os/OSNAME.inc.php\n by calling \npoll_mibs()\n with the\n    MIB module and name.  See \nincludes/discovery/os/ruckuswireless.inc.php\n\n    for an example.\n\n\nThat should be all you need to see MIB graphs!\n\n\nIf you want to develop more customised support for a particular OS, you\n    can follow the above process, then use the resultant data collected by\n    LibreNMS in the RRD files or the database tables \ndevice_oids\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nMain Configuration\n\n\nIn \n/opt/librenms/config.php\n add \n$config['poller_modules']['mib'] = 1;\n to enable MIB polling globally.\nAlternatively you can enable MIB polling per device by enabling it within the modules section for the specific device.\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\nYou need to add your desired MIBs to \n/opt/librenms/mibs\n folder. \nYou will then need to create a list of the OIDs you wish to use in the OS definition.\n\n\nExample\n\n\n/opt/librenms/includes/definitions/ruckuswireless.yaml\n\n\nregister_mibs:\n    ruckusZDSystemStats: RUCKUS-ZD-SYSTEM-MIB\n    ruckusZDWLANTable: RUCKUS-ZD-WLAN-MIB\n    ruckusZDWLANAPTable: RUCKUS-ZD-WLAN-MIB\n    ruckusZDWLANAPRadioStatsTable: RUCKUS-ZD-WLAN-MIB\n\n\n\n\nThese OIDs and MIBs will then be registered as part of the OS discovery ready for mib polling to work.\n\n\nTODO\n\n\nWhat's not included in MIB-based polling at present?  These may be present in\nfuture versions.  Pull requests gratefully accepted!\n\n\n\n\nParse and save integer and timetick data types.\n\n\nFilter MIBs/OIDs from being polled and/or saved.\n\n\nMove graphs from the MIB section to elsewhere. e.g. If a device uses a\n    unique MIB for CPU utilisation, we should display it under the relevant\n    health tab.\n\n\nCombine multiple MIB values into graphs automatically on a predefined or\n    user-defined basis.\n\n\nInclude MIB types in stats submissions.",

Configure how frequently the service will attempt to poll devices which are down in \n$config['poller_service_down_retry']\n.

If not all devices can be polled within the configured frequency, the service will continuously poll devices refreshing as frequently as possible using the configured number of threads.\n\n\nThe service logs to syslog.

Memcache is not required. Concurrency is managed using mysql GET_LOCK to ensure that devices are only being polled by one device at at time. The poller service is compatible with poller groups.\n\n\nMulti-Master MySQL considerations\n\n\nBecause locks are not replicated in Multi-Master MySQL configurations, if you are using such a configuration, you will need to make sure that all pollers are using the same MySQL server.\n\n\nSingle Connection\n\n\nIf you are running MariaDB 10.2 or newer, you can tell poller-service to use a single mysql connection for managing locks by setting \n$config['poller_service_single_connection']\n to \ntrue\n. \nDO NOT\n configure this for any version of MariaDB less than 10.2 or any version of MySQL.\n\n\nService Installation\n\n\nUpstart\n\n\nAn upstart configuration file can be found in \nscripts/librenms-poller-service.conf\n.

If you run a distributed setup then you can now run \n\nservices-wrapper.py\n in cron instead of \ncheck-services.php\n across all polling nodes.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, install Nagios plugins however you would like, this could be via yum, apt-get or direct from source.\n\n\nNext, you need to enable the services within config.php with the following:\n\n\n$config['show_services']           = 1;\n\n\n\n\nThis will enable a new service menu within your navbar.\n\n\n$config['nagios_plugins']   = \n/usr/lib/nagios/plugins\n;\n\n\n\n\nThis will point LibreNMS at the location of the nagios plugins - please ensure that any plugins you use are set to executable.\n\n\nFinally, you now need to add check-services.php to the current cron file (/etc/cron.d/librenms typically) like:\n\n\n*/5 * * * * librenms /opt/librenms/check-services.php \n /dev/null 2\n1\n\n\n\n\nNow you can add services via the main Services link in the navbar, or via the 'Add Service' link within the device, services page.\n\n\nPerformance data\n\n\nBy default, the check-services script will collect all performance data that the Nagios script returns and display each datasource on a separate graph.\nHowever for some modules it would be better if some of this information was consolidated on a single graph.\nAn example is the ICMP check. This check returns: Round Trip Average (rta), Round Trip Min (rtmin) and Round Trip Max (rtmax).\nThese have been combined onto a single graph.\n\n\nIf you find a check script that would benefit from having some datasources graphed together, please log an issue on GitHub with the debug information from the script, and let us know which DS's should go together.

Next, you need to enable the services within config.php with the following:  $config['show_services']           = 1;  This will enable a new service menu within your navbar.  $config['nagios_plugins']   =  /usr/lib/nagios/plugins ;  This will point LibreNMS at the location of the nagios plugins - please ensure that any plugins you use are set to executable.  Finally, you now need to add check-services.php to the current cron file (/etc/cron.d/librenms typically) like:  */5 * * * * librenms /opt/librenms/check-services.php   /dev/null 2 1  Now you can add services via the main Services link in the navbar, or via the 'Add Service' link within the device, services page.",

Add the following to your rsyslog config somewhere (could be at the top of the file in the step below, could be in  rsyslog.conf  if you are using remote logs for something else on this host)  # Listen for syslog messages on UDP:514\n$ModLoad imudp\n$UDPServerRun 514  Create a file called something like  /etc/rsyslog.d/30-librenms.conf  containing:  # Feed syslog messages to librenms\n$ModLoad omprog\n\n$template librenms, %fromhost%||%syslogfacility%||%syslogpriority%||%syslogseverity%||%syslogtag%||%$year%-%$month%-%$day% %timereported:8:25%||%msg%||%programname%\\n \n\n*.* action(type= omprog  binary= /opt/librenms/syslog.php  template= librenms )  stop  Ancient versions of rsyslog may require different syntax.

The  fromhost  property is preferred as it avoids problems caused by devices sending incorrect hostnames in syslog messages.

Here's an example of this:\n\n\nCommit example\n\n\n?php\n\n$no_refresh = true;\n\n$config_groups = get_config_by_group('alerting');\n\n$mail_conf = array(\n    array('name'               =\n 'alert.tolerance_window',\n          'descr'              =\n 'Tolerance window for cron',\n          'type'               =\n 'text',\n    ),\n);\n\necho '\n\ndiv class=\npanel-group\n id=\naccordion\n\n    \nform class=\nform-horizontal\n role=\nform\n action=\n method=\npost\n\n';\n\necho generate_dynamic_config_panel('Email transport',$config_groups,$mail_conf,'mail');\n\necho '\n    \n/form\n\n\n/div\n\n';\n\n\n\n\nAnd that should be it!",

Paul wrote an excellent blog post which touches on this: http://blog.librenms.org/2014/09/restful-apis/\n\n\nWe have currently settled on using versioning within the API end point itself \n/api/v0\n. As the API itself is new and still in active development we also decided that v0 would be the best starting point to indicate it's in development.\n\n\nTokens\n \ntop\n\n\nTo access any of the token end points you will be required to authenticate using a token. Tokens can be created directly from within the LibreNMS web interface by going to \n/api-access/\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick on 'Create API access token'.\n\n\nSelect the user you would like to generate the token for.\n\n\nEnter an optional description.\n\n\nClick Create API Token.\n\n\n\n\nEndpoints\n \ntop\n\n\nWhilst this documentation will describe and show examples of the end points, we've designed the API so you should be able to traverse through it without know any of the available API routes.\n\n\nYou can do this by first calling \n/api/v0\n:\n\n\ncurl -H 'X-Auth-Token: YOURAPITOKENHERE' https://librenms.org/api/v0\n\nOutput\n{\n \nlist_bgp\n: \nhttps://librenms.org/api/v0/bgp\n,\n  ...\n \nedit_rule\n: \nhttps://librenms.org/api/v0/rules\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nInput\n \ntop\n\n\nInput to the API is done in three different ways, sometimes a combination two or three of these.\n\n\n\n\nPassing parameters via the api route.

If you call this without any parameters then you will only get part of the inventory. This is because a lot of devices nest each component, for instance you may initially have the chassis, within this the ports - 1 being an sfp cage, then the sfp itself. The way this API call is designed is to enable a recursive lookup. The first call will retrieve the root entry, included within this response will be entPhysicalIndex, you can then call for entPhysicalContainedIn which will then return the next layer of results.\n\n\nRoute: /api/v0/inventory/:hostname\n\n\n\n\nhostname can be either the device hostname or the device id\n\n\n\n\nInput:\n\n\n\n\nentPhysicalClass: This is used to restrict the class of the inventory, for example you can specify chassis to only return items in the inventory that are labelled as chassis.\n\n\nentPhysicalContainedIn: This is used to retrieve items within the inventory assigned to a previous component, for example specifying the chassis (entPhysicalIndex) will retrieve all items where the chassis is the parent.\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ncurl -H 'X-Auth-Token:

You can do this either against\nall modules, single or multiple modules:\n\n\nAll Modules\n\n\n./discovery.php -h localhost -d\n\n\n\n\nSingle Module\n\n\n./discovery.php -h localhost -m ports -d\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Modules\n\n\n./discovery.php -h localhost -m ports,entity-physical -d\n\n\n\n\nUsing \n-d\n shouldn't output much sensitive information, \n-v\n will so it is then advisable to sanitise the output before pasting it somewhere as the debug output will contain snmp details amongst other items including port descriptions.\n\n\nThe output will contain:\n\n\nDB Updates\n\n\nSNMP Response\n\n\nSNMP Scan\n\n\nApart from the aforementioned Auto-Discovery options, LibreNMS is also able to proactively scan a network for SNMP-enabled devices using the configured version/credentials.\n\n\nUsing the SNMP-Scanner may take a long time to finish depending on the size of your network. Tests have shown that a sparsely-populated /24 is scanned within 2 Minutes whereas a sparsely populated /16 will take about 11 Hours.\n\n\nIf possible, divide your network into smaller subnets and scan these subnets instead. You can use an utility like the GNU Screen or tmux to avoid aborting the scan when logging out of your Shell. You can run several instances of the SNMP-Scanner simultaneously.\n\n\nTo run the SNMP-Scanner you need to execute the \nsnmp-scan.php\n from within your LibreNMS installation directory.\n\n\nHere the script's help-page for reference:\n\n\nUsage: ./snmp-scan.php -r \nCIDR_Range\n [-d] [-l] [-h]\n  -r CIDR_Range     CIDR noted IP-Range to scan\n                    Example: 192.168.0.0/24\n  -d                Enable Debug\n  -l                Show Legend\n  -h                Print this text",

Enter the details required for the device that you want to add and then click 'Add Host'.\n\n\n\n\n How do I get help?\n\n\nWe have a few methods for you to get in touch to ask for help.\n\n\nCommunity Forum\n\n\nIRC\n Freenode ##librenms\n\n\nBug Reports\n\n\n What are the supported OSes for installing LibreNMS on?\n\n\nSupported is quite a strong word :) The 'officially' supported distros are:\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu / Debian\n\n\nRed Hat / CentOS\n\n\nGentoo\n\n\n\n\nHowever we will always aim to help wherever possible so if you are running a distro that isn't one of the above then give it a try anyway and if you need help then jump on the irc channel.\n\n\n Do you have a demo available?\n\n\nWe do indeed, you can find access to the demo \nhere\n\n\n Why do I get blank pages sometimes in the WebUI?\n\n\nThe first thing to do is to add /debug=yes/ to the end of the URI (I.e /devices/debug=yes/).\n\n\nIf the page you are trying to load has a substantial amount of data in it then it could be that the php memory limit needs to be increased in php.ini and then your web service reloaded.\n\n\n Why do I not see any graphs?\n\n\nThe easiest way to check if all is well is to run \n./validate.php\n as root from within your install directory. This should give you info on why things aren't working.\n\n\nOne other reason could be a restricted snmpd.conf file or snmp view which limits the data sent back. If you use net-snmp then we suggest using \nthe (included snmpd.conf)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/librenms/librenms/master/snmpd.conf.example] file.\n\n\n How do I debug pages not loading correctly?\n\n\nA debug system is in place which enables you to see the output from php errors, warnings and notices along with the MySQL queries that have been run for that page.\n\n\nTo enable the debug option, add /debug=yes/ to the end of any URI (I.e /devices/debug=yes/) or ?debug=yes if you are debugging a graph directly.\n\n\nYou will then have a two options in the footer of the website - Show SQL Debug and Show PHP Debug. These will both popup that pages debug window for you to view. If the page itself has generated a fatal error then this will be displayed directly on the page.\n\n\n How do I debug the discovery process?\n\n\nPlease see the \nDiscovery Support\n document for further details.\n\n\n How do I debug the poller process?\n\n\nPlease see the \nPoller Support\n document for further details.\n\n\n Why do I get a lot apache or rrdtool zombies in my process list?\n\n\nIf this is related to your web service for LibreNMS then this has been tracked down to an issue within php which the developers aren't fixing. We have implemented a work around which means you\nshouldn't be seeing this. If you are, please report this in \nissue 443\n.\n\n\n Why do I see traffic spikes in my graphs?\n\n\nThis occurs either when a counter resets or the device sends back bogus data making it look like a counter reset. We have enabled support for setting a maximum value for rrd files for ports.\n\n\nBefore this all rrd files were set to 100G max values, now you can enable support to limit this to the actual port speed.\n\n\nrrdtool tune will change the max value when the interface speed is detected as being changed (min value will be set for anything 10M or over) or when you run the included script (./scripts/tune_port.php) - see \nRRDTune doc\n\n\n Why do I see gaps in my graphs?\n\n\nThis is most commonly due to the poller not being able to complete it's run within 300 seconds. Check which devices are causing this by going to /poll-log/ within the Web interface.\n\n\nWhen you find the device(s) which are taking the longest you can then look at the Polling module graph under Graphs -\n Poller -\n Poller Modules Performance. Take a look at what modules are taking the longest and disabled un used modules.\n\n\nIf you poll a large number of devices / ports then it's recommended to run a local recurisve dns server such as pdns-recursor.\n\n\nRunning RRDCached is also highly advised in larger installs but has benefits no matter the size.\n\n\n How do I change the IP / hostname of a device?\n\n\nThere is a host rename tool called renamehost.php in your librenms root directory. When renaming you are also changing the device's IP / hostname address for monitoring.\nUsage:\n\n\n./renamehost.php \nold hostname\n \nnew hostname\n\n\n\n\n\n My device doesn't finish polling within 300 seconds\n\n\nWe have a few things you can try:\n\n\n\n\nDisable unnecessary polling modules under edit device.\n\n\nSet a max repeater value within the snmp settings for a device.\n    What to set this to is tricky, you really should run an snmpbulkwalk with -Cr10 through -Cr50 to see what works best. 50 is usually a good choice if the device can cope.\n\n\n\n\n Things aren't working correctly?\n\n\nRun \n./validate.php\n as root from within your install.\n\n\nRe-run \n./validate.php\n once you've resolved any issues raised.\n\n\nYou have an odd issue - we'd suggest you join our irc channel to discuss.\n\n\n What do the values mean in my graphs?\n\n\nThe values you see are reported as metric values. Thanks to a post on \nReddit\n \nhere are those values:\n\n\n10^-18  a - atto\n10^-15  f - femto\n10^-12  p - pico\n10^-9   n - nano\n10^-6   u - micro\n10^-3   m - milli\n0    (no unit)\n10^3    k - kilo\n10^6    M - mega\n10^9    G - giga\n10^12   T - tera\n10^15   P - peta\n\n\n\n\n Why does a device show as a warning?\n\n\nThis is indicating that the device has rebooted within the last 24 hours (by default). If you want to adjust this \nthreshold then you can do so by setting \n$config['uptime_warning']\n in config.php. The value must be in seconds.\n\n\n Why do I not see all interfaces in the Overall traffic graph for a device?\n\n\nBy default numerous interface types and interface descriptions are excluded from this graph. The excluded defailts are:\n\n\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/loopback/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/tunnel/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/virtual/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/mpls/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/ieee8023adLag/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/l2vlan/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/ppp/';\n\n$config['device_traffic_descr'][] = '/loopback/';\n$config['device_traffic_descr'][] = '/vlan/';\n$config['device_traffic_descr'][] = '/tunnel/';\n$config['device_traffic_descr'][] = '/bond/';\n$config['device_traffic_descr'][] = '/null/';\n$config['device_traffic_descr'][] = '/dummy/';\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to re-include l2vlan interfaces for instance, you first need to \nunset\n the config array and set your options:\n\n\nunset($config['device_traffic_iftype']);\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/loopback/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/tunnel/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/virtual/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/mpls/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/ieee8023adLag/';\n$config['device_traffic_iftype'][] = '/ppp/';\n\n\n\n\n How do I move my LibreNMS install to another server?\n\n\nIf you are moving from one CPU architecture to another then you will need to dump the rrd files and re-create them. If you are in     \n\nthis scenario then you can use \nDan Brown's migration scripts\n.        \n\n\nIf you are just moving to another server with the same CPU architecture then the following steps should be all that's needed:       \n\n\n- Install LibreNMS as per our normal documentation, you don't need to run through the web installer or building the sql schema.     \n- Stop cron by commenting out all lines in `/etc/cron.d/librenms`\n- Dump the MySQL database `librenms` and import this into your new server.\n- Copy the `rrd/` folder to the new server.\n- Copy the `config.php` file to the new server.\n- Renable cron by uncommenting all lines in `/etc/cron.d/librenms`\n\n\n\n Why is my EdgeRouter device not detected?\n\n\nIf you have \nservice snmp description\n set in your config then this will be why, please remove this. For some reason Ubnt have decided setting this \n value should override the sysDescr value returned which breaks our detection.\n\n\nIf you don't have that set then this may be then due to an update of EdgeOS or a new device type, please \ncreate an issue\n.\n\n\n Why are some of my disks not showing?\n\n\nIf you are monitoring a linux server then net-snmp doesn't always expose all disks via hrStorage (HOST-RESOURCES-MIB). We have additional support which will retrieve disks via dskTable (UCD-SNMP-MIB). \nTo expose these disks you need to add additional config to your snmpd.conf file. For example, to expose \n/dev/sda1\n which may be mounted as \n/storage\n you can specify:\n\n\ndisk /dev/sda1\n\n\nOr\n\n\ndisk /storage\n\n\nRestart snmpd and LibreNMS should populate the additional disk after a fresh discovery.\n\n\n Why are my disks reporting an incorrect size?\n\n\nThere is a known issue for net-snmp, which causes it to report incorrect disk size and disk usage when the size of the disk (or raid) are larger then 16TB, a workaround has been implemented but is not active on Centos 6.8 by default due to the fact that this workaround breaks official SNMP specs, and as such could cause unexpected behaviour in other SNMP tools.

The biggest area that people can help make this happen is by providing code support. This doesn't necessarily mean contributing code for discovering a new device:\n\n\nWeb UI, a new look and feel has been adopted but we are not finished by any stretch of the imagination. Make suggestions, find and fix bugs, update the design / layout.\n\n\nPoller / Discovery code. Improving it (we think a lot can be done to speed things up), adding new device support and updating old ones.\n\n\nThe LibreNMS main website, this is hosted on Git Hub like the main repo and we accept use contributions here as well :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware.

Found one? We want to know about it. Most bugs are fixed after being spotted and reported by someone, I'd love to say we are amazing developers and will fix all bugs before you spot them but that's just not true.\n\n\nFeature requests. Can't code / won't code. No worries, chuck a feature request into Git Hub with enough detail and someone will take a look. A lot of the time this might be what interests someone, they need the same feature or they just have time. Please be patient, everyone who contributes does so in their own time.\n\n\nBe nice, this is the foundation of this project. We expect everyone to be nice. People will fall out, people will disagree but please do it so in a respectable way.\n\n\nAsk questions. Sometimes just by asking questions you prompt deeper conversations that can lead us to somewhere amazing so please never be afraid to ask a question.\n\n\n\n\n How can I test another users branch?\n\n\nLibreNMS can and is developed by anyone, this means someone may be working on a new feature or support for a device that you want.\nIt can be helpful for others to test these new features, using Git, this is made easy.\n\n\ncd /opt/librenms\n\n\n\n\nFirstly ensure that your current branch is in good state:\n\n\ngit status\n\n\n\n\nIf you see \nnothing to commit, working directory clean\n then let's go for it :)\n\n\nLet's say that you want to test a users (f0o) new development branch (issue-1337) then you can do the following:\n\n\ngit remote add f0o https://github.com/f0o/librenms.git\ngit remote update f0o\ngit checkout issue-1337\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are done testing, you can easily switch back to the master branch:\n\n\ngit checkout master\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to pull any new updates provided by f0o's branch then whilst you are still in it, do the following:\n\n\ngit pull f0o issue-1337",

This will have the possibility that you could lose up to 1 second on mysql data in the event\nMySQL crashes or your server does but it provides an amazing difference in IO use.\n\n\nPolling modules\n\n\nDisable polling (and discovery) modules that you do not need. You can do this globally in \nconfig.php\n like:\n\n\nDisable OSPF polling\n\n\n$config['poller_modules']['ospf'] = 0;\n\n\n\n\nYou can disable modules globally then re-enable the module per device or the opposite way. For a list of modules please see\n\nPoller modules\n\n\nSNMP Max Repeaters\n\n\nWe have support for SNMP Max repeaters which can be handy on devices where we poll a lot of ports or bgp sessions for instance and \nwhere snmpwalk or snmpbulkwalk is used. This needs to be enabled on a per device basis under edit device -\n snmp -\n Max repeaters.\n\n\nYou can also set this globally with the config option \n$config['snmp']['max_repeaters'] = X;\n.\n\n\nIt's advisable to test the time taken to snmpwalk IF-MIB or something similar to work out what the best value is. To do this run the following \nbut replace \n with varying numbers from 10 upto around 50. You will also need to set the correct snmp version, hostname and community string:\n\n\ntime snmpbulkwalk -v2c -cpublic HOSTNAME -Cr\nREPEATERS\n -M /opt/librenms/mibs -m IF-MIB IfEntry\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Do not go blindly setting this value as you can impact polling negatively.\n\n\n\n\nSNMP Max OIDs\n\n\nFor sensors polling we now do bulk snmp gets to speed things up. By default this is ten but you can overwrite this per device under \nedit device -\n snmp -\n Max OIDs.\n\n\nYou can also set this globally with the config option \n$config['snmp']['max_oid'] = X;\n.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: It is advisable to monitor sensor polling when you change this to ensure you don't set the value too high.\n\n\n\n\nOptimise poller-wrapper\n\n\nThe default 16 threads that \npoller-wrapper.py\n runs as isn't necessarily the optimal number. A general rule of thumb is \n2 threads per core but we suggest that you play around with lowering / increasing the number until you get the optimal value.\n\n\nRecursive DNS\n\n\nIf your install uses hostnames for devices and you have quite a lot then it's advisable to setup a local recursive dns instance on the \nLibreNMS server. Something like pdns-recursor can be used and then configure \n/etc/resolv.conf\n to use 127.0.0.1 for queries.\n\n\nPer port polling - experimental\n\n\nBy default the polling ports module will walk ifXEntry + some items from ifEntry regardless of the port. So if a port is marked as deleted because you don't want to see them \nor it's disabled then we still collect data. For the most part this is fine as the walks are quite quick. However for devices with a lot of ports and good % of those are \neither deleted or disabled then this approach isn't optimal. So to counter this you can enable 'selected port polling' per device within the edit device -\n misc section or by\nglobally enabling it (not recommended): \n$config['polling']['selected_ports'] = true;\n.\n\n\nIf you would like to see if you should turn this on then run this query in MySQL: \nselect device_id, count(*) as total from ports where deleted=1 group by device_id order by total desc;\n. You will see output like the following:\n\n\n+-----------+-------+\n| device_id | total |\n+-----------+-------+\n|       128 |   339 |\n|        92 |    56 |\n|        41 |    41 |\n|        38 |     3 |\n|        81 |     2 |\n\n\nHere device id 128 and potentially 92 and 41 are likely candidates for this feature to be enabled on. Turn it on and then closely monitor the device for the next 15-30 minutes.\n\n\nWeb interface\n\n\nHTTP/2\n\n\nIf you are running https then you should enable http/2 support in whatever web server you use:\n\n\nFor Nginx (1.9.5 and above) change \nlisten 443 http2;\n to \nlisten 443 ssl http2;\n in the Virtualhost config.\n\n\nFor Apache (2.4.17 an above) set \nProtocols h2 http/1.1\n in the Virtualhost config.",

            "text": "Remote monitoring using tinc VPN\n\n\nThis article describes how to use tinc to connect several remote sites and their subnets to your central monitoring server. This will let you connect to devices on remote private IP ranges through one gateway on each site, routing them securely back to your LibreNMS installation.\n\n\nConfiguring the monitoring server\n\n\ntinc should be available on nearly all Linux distributions via package management. If you are running something different, just take a look at tinc's homepage to find an appropriate version for your operating system: https://www.tinc-vpn.org/download/\nI am going to describe the setup for Debian-based systems, but there are virtually no differences for e.g. CentOS or similar.\n\n\n\n\nFirst make sure your firewall accepts connections on port 655 UDP and TCP. \n\n\nThen install tinc via \napt-get install tinc\n. \n\n\nCreate the following directory structure to hold all your configuration files: \nmkdir -p /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts\n \"myvpn\" is your VPN network's name and can be chosen freely.\n\n\nCreate your main configuration file: \nvim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc.conf\n\n\n\n\nName = monitoring\nAddressFamily = ipv4\nDevice = /dev/net/tun\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we need network up- and down scripts to define a few network settings for inside our VPN: \nvim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-up\n\n\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\nifconfig $INTERFACE 10.6.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0\nip route add 10.6.1.1/24 dev $INTERFACE\nip route add 10.0.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE\nip route add 10.100.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE\nip route add 10.200.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE\n\n\n\n\nIn this example we have 10.6.1.1 as the VPN IP address for the monitoring server on a /24 subnet. $INTERFACE will be automatically substituted with the name of the VPN, \"myvpn\" in this case. Then we have a route for the VPN subnet, so we can reach other sites via their VPN address. The last 3 lines designate the remote subnets. In the example I want to reach devices on three different remote private /22 subnets and be able to monitor devices on them from this server, so I set up routes for each of those remote sites in my tinc-up script.\n\n\n\n\nThe tinc-down script is relatively simple as it just removes the custom interface, which should get rid of the routes as well: \nvim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-down\n\n\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\nifconfig $INTERFACE down\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure your scripts scan be executed: \nchmod +x /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-*\n\n\nAs a last step we need a host configuration file. This should be named the same as the \"Name\" you defined in tinc.conf: \nvim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring\n\n\n\n\nSubnet = 10.6.1.1/32\n\n\n\n\nOn the monitoring server we will just fill in the subnet and not define its external IP address to make sure it listens on all available external interfaces.\n\n\n\n\nIt's time to use tinc to create our key-pair: \ntincd -n myvpn -K\n\n\nNow the file \n/etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring\n should have an RSA public key appended to it and your private key should reside in \n/etc/tinc/myvpn/rsa_key.priv\n.\n\n\nTo make sure that the connection will be restored after each reboot, you can add your VPN name to \n/etc/tinc/nets.boot\n.\n\n\nNow you can start tinc with \ntincd -n myvpn\n and it will listen for your remote sites to connect to it.\n\n\n\n\nRemote site configuration\n\n\nEssentially the same steps as for your central monitoring server apply for all remote gateway devices. These can be routers, or just any computer or VM running on the remote subnet, able to reach the internet with the ability to forward IP packets externally.\n\n\n\n\nInstall tinc\n\n\nCreate directory structure: \nmkdir -p /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts\n\n\nCreate main configuration: \nvim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc.conf\n\n\n\n\nName = remote1\nAddressFamily = ipv4\nDevice = /dev/net/tun\nConnectTo = monitoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate up script: \nvim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-up\n\n\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\nifconfig $INTERFACE 10.6.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0\nip route add 10.6.1.2/32 dev $INTERFACE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate down script: \nvim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-down\n\n\n\n\n#!/bin/sh\nifconfig $INTERFACE down\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake executable: \nchmod +x /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc*\n\n\nCreate device configuration: \nvim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/remote1\n\n\n\n\nAddress = 198.51.100.2\nSubnet = 10.0.0.0/22\n\n\n\n\nThis defines the device IP address outside of the VPN and the subnet it will expose.\n\n\n\n\nCopy over the monitoring server's host configuration (including the embedded public key) and add it's external IP address: \nvim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring\n\n\n\n\nAddress = 203.0.113.6\nSubnet = 10.6.1.1/32\n\n-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----\nVeDyaqhKd4o2Fz...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate this device's keys: \ntincd -n myvpn -K\n\n\nCopy over this devices host file including the embedded public key to your monitoring server.\n\n\nAdd the name for the VPN to\n/etc/tinc/nets.boot\n if you want to autostart the connection upon reboot.\n\n\nStart tinc: \ntincd -n myvpn\n\n\n\n\nThese steps can basically be repeated for every remote site just choosing different names and other internal IP addresses. In my case I connected 3 remote sites running behind Ubiquiti EdgeRouters. Since those devices let me install software through Debian's package management it was very easy to set up. Just create the necessary configuration files and network scripts on each device and distribute the host configurations including the public keys to each device that will actively connect back.\n\n\nNow you can add all devices you want to monitor in LibreNMS using their internal IP address on the remote subnets or using some form of name resolution. I opted to declare the most important devices in my \n/etc/hosts\n file on the monitoring server.\n\n\nAs an added bonus tinc is a mesh VPN, so in theory you could specify several \"ConnectTo\" on each device and they should hold connections even if one network path goes down.",

Create your main configuration file:  vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc.conf   Name = monitoring\nAddressFamily = ipv4\nDevice = /dev/net/tun   Next we need network up- and down scripts to define a few network settings for inside our VPN:  vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-up   #!/bin/sh\nifconfig $INTERFACE 10.6.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0\nip route add 10.6.1.1/24 dev $INTERFACE\nip route add 10.0.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE\nip route add 10.100.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE\nip route add 10.200.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE  In this example we have 10.6.1.1 as the VPN IP address for the monitoring server on a /24 subnet. $INTERFACE will be automatically substituted with the name of the VPN, \"myvpn\" in this case. Then we have a route for the VPN subnet, so we can reach other sites via their VPN address. The last 3 lines designate the remote subnets. In the example I want to reach devices on three different remote private /22 subnets and be able to monitor devices on them from this server, so I set up routes for each of those remote sites in my tinc-up script.   The tinc-down script is relatively simple as it just removes the custom interface, which should get rid of the routes as well:  vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-down   #!/bin/sh\nifconfig $INTERFACE down   Make sure your scripts scan be executed:  chmod +x /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-*  As a last step we need a host configuration file. This should be named the same as the \"Name\" you defined in tinc.conf:  vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring   Subnet = 10.6.1.1/32  On the monitoring server we will just fill in the subnet and not define its external IP address to make sure it listens on all available external interfaces.   It's time to use tinc to create our key-pair:  tincd -n myvpn -K  Now the file  /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring  should have an RSA public key appended to it and your private key should reside in  /etc/tinc/myvpn/rsa_key.priv .  To make sure that the connection will be restored after each reboot, you can add your VPN name to  /etc/tinc/nets.boot .  Now you can start tinc with  tincd -n myvpn  and it will listen for your remote sites to connect to it.",

            "text": "Essentially the same steps as for your central monitoring server apply for all remote gateway devices. These can be routers, or just any computer or VM running on the remote subnet, able to reach the internet with the ability to forward IP packets externally.   Install tinc  Create directory structure:  mkdir -p /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts  Create main configuration:  vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc.conf   Name = remote1\nAddressFamily = ipv4\nDevice = /dev/net/tun\nConnectTo = monitoring   Create up script:  vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-up   #!/bin/sh\nifconfig $INTERFACE 10.6.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0\nip route add 10.6.1.2/32 dev $INTERFACE   Create down script:  vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-down   #!/bin/sh\nifconfig $INTERFACE down   Make executable:  chmod +x /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc*  Create device configuration:  vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/remote1   Address = 198.51.100.2\nSubnet = 10.0.0.0/22  This defines the device IP address outside of the VPN and the subnet it will expose.   Copy over the monitoring server's host configuration (including the embedded public key) and add it's external IP address:  vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring   Address = 203.0.113.6\nSubnet = 10.6.1.1/32\n\n-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----\nVeDyaqhKd4o2Fz...   Generate this device's keys:  tincd -n myvpn -K  Copy over this devices host file including the embedded public key to your monitoring server.  Add the name for the VPN to /etc/tinc/nets.boot  if you want to autostart the connection upon reboot.  Start tinc:  tincd -n myvpn   These steps can basically be repeated for every remote site just choosing different names and other internal IP addresses. In my case I connected 3 remote sites running behind Ubiquiti EdgeRouters. Since those devices let me install software through Debian's package management it was very easy to set up. Just create the necessary configuration files and network scripts on each device and distribute the host configurations including the public keys to each device that will actively connect back.  Now you can add all devices you want to monitor in LibreNMS using their internal IP address on the remote subnets or using some form of name resolution. I opted to declare the most important devices in my  /etc/hosts  file on the monitoring server.  As an added bonus tinc is a mesh VPN, so in theory you could specify several \"ConnectTo\" on each device and they should hold connections even if one network path goes down.",

If you're not familiar with git, check out the \ngit book\n or the tips at \ngit ready\n.  The initial install from github.com is called a \ngit clone\n; subsequent updates are done through \ngit pull\n.\n\n\nYou can clone the repository via HTTPS or SSH.  In either case, you need to ensure that the appropriate port (443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH) is open in the outbound direction for your server.\n\n\ncd /opt\ngit clone https://github.com/librenms/librenms.git librenms\ncd /opt/librenms\n\n\n\nThe recommended method of cloning a git repository is HTTPS.  If you would like to clone via SSH instead, use the command \ngit clone git@github.com:librenms/librenms.git librenms\n instead.\n\n\nSometimes the initial clone can take quite a while (nearly 3 minutes on a 10 Mbps fibre connection in Australia is a recent example).  If it's a big problem to you, you can save about 50% of the bandwidth by not pulling down the full git history.  This comes with some limitations (namely that you can't use it as the basis for further git repos), but if you're not planning to develop for LibreNMS it's an acceptable option.  To perform the initial clone without full history, run the following instead:\n\n\ncd /opt\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/librenms/librenms.git librenms\ncd /opt/librenms\n\n\n\nWeb Interface\n\n\nTo prepare the web interface (and adding devices shortly), you'll need to create and chown a directory as well as create a Nginx vhost.\n\n\nFirst, create and chown the \nrrd\n directory and create the \nlogs\n directory:\n\n\nmkdir rrd logs\nchown -R librenms:librenms /opt/librenms\nchmod 775 rrd\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: If you're not running Ubuntu or Debian, you will need to change \nwww-data\n to the user and group which run the Nginx web server.\nIf you're planing on running rrdcached, make sure that the path is also chmod'ed to 775 and chown'ed to librenms:librenms.\n\n\n\n\nAdd configuration for \nnginx\n at \n/etc/nginx/conf.d/librenms.conf\n with the following content:\n\n\nserver {\n listen      80;\n server_name librenms.example.com;\n root        /opt/librenms/html;\n index       index.php;\n access_log  /opt/librenms/logs/access_log;\n error_log   /opt/librenms/logs/error_log;\n gzip on;\n gzip_types text/css application/x-javascript text/richtext image/svg+xml text/plain    text/xsd text/xsl text/xml image/x-icon;\n location / {\n  try_files $uri $uri/ @librenms;\n }\n location ~ \\.php {\n  fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;\n  include fastcgi_params;\n  fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\\.php)(/.+)$;\n  fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;\n }\n location ~ /\\.ht {\n  deny all;\n }\n location @librenms {\n  rewrite api/v0(.*)$ /api_v0.php/$1 last;\n  rewrite ^(.+)$ /index.php/$1 last;\n }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOn at least Ubuntu 14.04 (and possibly other distributions and versions as well), mcrypt is not enabled on install.  Run the following to enable it:\n\n\nphp5enmod mcrypt\n\n\n\n(To get to your LibreNMS install externally, you'll also need add it to your DNS or hosts file.)\n\n\nStart the web-server:\n\n\nRestart nginx:\n\n\nservice nginx restart\n\n\n\nRestart php5-fpm:\n\n\nservice php5-fpm restart\n\n\n\nManual vs. web installer\n\n\nAt this stage you can either launch the web installer by going to http://librenms.example.com/install.php, follow the onscreen instructions then skip to the 'Add localhost' section. Alternatively if you want to continue the setup manually then just keep following these instructions.\n\n\ncp config.php.default config.php\nvim config.php\n\n\n\nChange the values to the right of the equal sign for lines beginning with \n$config[db_]\n to match your database information as setup above.\n\n\nChange the value of \n$config['snmp']['community']\n from \npublic\n to whatever your read-only SNMP community is.  If you have multiple communities, set it to the most common.\n\n\n Be sure you have no characters (including whitespace like: newlines, spaces, tabs, etc) outside of the \n?php?\n blocks. Your graphs will break otherwise. \n\n\nInitialise the database\n\n\nInitiate the follow database with the following command:\n\n\nphp build-base.php\n\n\n\nCreate admin user\n\n\nCreate the admin user - priv should be 10\n\n\nphp adduser.php \nname\n \npass\n 10 \nemail\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute your desired username, password and email address--and leave the angled brackets off.\n\n\nValidate your install\n\n\nRun validate.php as root in the librenms directory\n\n\nphp validate.php\n\n\n\nThis will check your install to verify it is set up correctly.\n\n\nAdd localhost\n\n\nphp addhost.php localhost public v2c\n\n\n\nThis assumes you haven't made community changes--if you have, replace \npublic\n with your community.  It also assumes SNMP v2c.  If you're using v3, there are additional steps (NOTE: instructions for SNMPv3 to come).\n\n\nDiscover localhost::\n\n\nphp discovery.php -h all\n\n\n\nCreate cronjob\n\n\nLibreNMS uses Job Snijders' \npoller-wrapper.py\n.  By default, the cron job runs \npoller-wrapper.py\n with 16 threads.  The current recommendation is to use 4 threads per core as a rule of thumb.  If the thread count needs to be changed, you can do so by editing the cron file (\n/etc/cron.d/librenms\n).  Just add a number after \npoller-wrapper.py\n, as in the example below:\n\n\n/opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 12 \n /dev/null 2\n1\n\n\n\nCreate the cronjob\n\n\ncp librenms.nonroot.cron /etc/cron.d/librenms\n\n\n\nCopy logrotate config\n\n\nLibreNMS keeps logs in \n/opt/librenms/logs\n. Over time these can become large and be rotated out.  To rotate out the old logs you can use the provided logrotate config file:\n\n\ncp misc/librenms.logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/librenms\n\n\n\nDaily Updates\n\n\nLibreNMS performs daily updates by default.  At 00:15 system time every day, a \ngit pull --no-edit --quiet\n is performed.  You can override this default by editing your \nconfig.php\n file.  Remove the comment (the \n#\n mark) on the line:\n\n\n#$config['update'] = 0;\n\n\n\nso that it looks like this:\n\n\n$config['update'] = 0;\n\n\n\nInstall complete\n\n\nPlease allow for 2-3 runs of the poller-wrapper for data to start appearing in the WebUI.\nIf you don't see data after this, please refer to the \nFAQ\n for assistance.\n\n\nThat's it!  You now should be able to log in to http://librenms.example.com/.  Please note that we have not covered HTTPS setup in this example, so your LibreNMS install is not secure by default.  Please do not expose it to the public Internet unless you have configured HTTPS and taken appropriate web server hardening steps.\n\n\nIt would be great if you would consider opting into the stats system we have, please see \nthis page\n on what it is and how to enable it.",

If you're not familiar with git, check out the \ngit book\n or the tips at \ngit ready\n.  The initial install from github.com is called a \ngit clone\n; subsequent updates are done through \ngit pull\n.\n\n\nYou can clone the repository via HTTPS or SSH.  In either case, you need to ensure that the appropriate port (443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH) is open in the outbound direction for your server.\n\n\ncd /opt\ngit clone https://github.com/librenms/librenms.git librenms\ncd /opt/librenms\n\n\n\nThe recommended method of cloning a git repository is HTTPS.  If you would like to clone via SSH instead, use the command \ngit clone git@github.com:librenms/librenms.git librenms\n instead.\n\n\nSometimes the initial clone can take quite a while (nearly 3 minutes on a 10 Mbps fibre connection in Australia is a recent example).  If it's a big problem to you, you can save about 50% of the bandwidth by not pulling down the full git history.  This comes with some limitations (namely that you can't use it as the basis for further git repos), but if you're not planning to develop for LibreNMS it's an acceptable option.  To perform the initial clone without full history, run the following instead:\n\n\ncd /opt\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/librenms/librenms.git librenms\ncd /opt/librenms\n\n\n\nWeb Interface\n\n\nTo prepare the web interface (and adding devices shortly), you'll need to create and chown a directory as well as create an Apache vhost.\n\n\nFirst, create and chown the \nrrd\n directory and create the \nlogs\n directory:\n\n\nmkdir rrd logs\nchown -R librenms:librenms /opt/librenms\nchmod 775 rrd\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: If you're not running Ubuntu or Debian, you will need to change \nwww-data\n to the user and group which run the Apache web server.\nIf you're planing on running rrdcached, make sure that the path is also chmod'ed to 775 and chown'ed to librenms:librenms.\n\n\n\n\nNext, add the following to \n/etc/apache2/sites-available/librenms.conf\n:\n\n\nVirtualHost *:80\n\n  DocumentRoot /opt/librenms/html/\n  ServerName  librenms.example.com\n  CustomLog /opt/librenms/logs/access_log combined\n  ErrorLog /opt/librenms/logs/error_log\n  AllowEncodedSlashes On\n  \nDirectory \n/opt/librenms/html/\n\n    AllowOverride All\n    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n  \n/Directory\n\n\n/VirtualHost\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are running Apache 2.2.18 or higher then change \nAllowEncodedSlashes On\n to \nAllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode\n\n\nIf you have Apache 2.3 or newer then please add the following line before \nAllowOverride All\n:\n\n\nRequire all granted\n\n\n\nOn at least Ubuntu 14.04 (and possibly other distributions and versions as well), mcrypt is not enabled on install.  Run the following to enable it:\n\n\nphp5enmod mcrypt\n\n\n\nChange \nlibrenms.example.com\n to the appropriate hostname for your domain, then enable the vhost and restart Apache:\n\n\na2ensite librenms.conf\na2enmod rewrite\nservice apache2 restart\n\n\n\nIf this is the only site you are hosting on this server (it should be :)) then you will need to disable the default site setup in Ubuntu:\n\n\na2dissite 000-default\n\n\n\n(To get to your LibreNMS install externally, you'll also need add it to your DNS or hosts file.)\n\n\nManual vs. web installer\n\n\nAt this stage you can either launch the web installer by going to http://librenms.example.com/install.php, follow the onscreen instructions then skip to the 'Add localhost' section. Alternatively if you want to continue the setup manually then just keep following these instructions.\n\n\ncp config.php.default config.php\nvim config.php\n\n\n\nChange the values to the right of the equal sign for lines beginning with \n$config[db_]\n to match your database information as setup above.\n\n\nChange the value of \n$config['snmp']['community']\n from \npublic\n to whatever your read-only SNMP community is.  If you have multiple communities, set it to the most common.\n\n\n Be sure you have no characters (including whitespace like: newlines, spaces, tabs, etc) outside of the \n?php?\n blocks. Your graphs will break otherwise. \n\n\nInitialise the database\n\n\nInitiate the follow database with the following command:\n\n\nphp build-base.php\n\n\n\nCreate admin user\n\n\nCreate the admin user - priv should be 10\n\n\nphp adduser.php \nname\n \npass\n 10 \nemail\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute your desired username, password and email address--and leave the angled brackets off.\n\n\nValidate your install\n\n\nRun validate.php as root in the librenms directory\n\n\nphp validate.php\n\n\n\nThis will check your install to verify it is set up correctly.\n\n\nAdd localhost\n\n\nphp addhost.php localhost public v2c\n\n\n\nThis assumes you haven't made community changes--if you have, replace \npublic\n with your community.  It also assumes SNMP v2c.  If you're using v3, there are additional steps (NOTE: instructions for SNMPv3 to come).\n\n\nDiscover localhost::\n\n\nphp discovery.php -h all\n\n\n\nCreate cronjob\n\n\nLibreNMS uses Job Snijders' \npoller-wrapper.py\n.  By default, the cron job runs \npoller-wrapper.py\n with 16 threads.  The current recommendation is to use 4 threads per core as a rule of thumb.  If the thread count needs to be changed, you can do so by editing the cron file (\n/etc/cron.d/librenms\n).  Just add a number after \npoller-wrapper.py\n, as in the example below:\n\n\n/opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 12 \n /dev/null 2\n1\n\n\n\nCreate the cronjob\n\n\ncp librenms.nonroot.cron /etc/cron.d/librenms\n\n\n\nCopy logrotate config\n\n\nLibreNMS keeps logs in \n/opt/librenms/logs\n. Over time these can become large and be rotated out.  To rotate out the old logs you can use the provided logrotate config file:\n\n\ncp misc/librenms.logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/librenms\n\n\n\nDaily Updates\n\n\nLibreNMS performs daily updates by default.  At 00:15 system time every day, a \ngit pull --no-edit --quiet\n is performed.  You can override this default by editing your \nconfig.php\n file.  Remove the comment (the \n#\n mark) on the line:\n\n\n#$config['update'] = 0;\n\n\n\nso that it looks like this:\n\n\n$config['update'] = 0;\n\n\n\nInstall complete\n\n\nPlease allow for 2-3 runs of the poller-wrapper for data to start appearing in the WebUI.\nIf you don't see data after this, please refer to the \nFAQ\n for assistance.\n\n\nThat's it!  You now should be able to log in to http://librenms.example.com/.  Please note that we have not covered HTTPS setup in this example, so your LibreNMS install is not secure by default.  Please do not expose it to the public Internet unless you have configured HTTPS and taken appropriate web server hardening steps.\n\n\nIt would be great if you would consider opting into the stats system we have, please see \nthis page\n on what it is and how to enable it.",

The default if no thread count is \n16 threads\n.\n\n\nIf the thread count needs to be changed, you can do so by editing the cron file (\n/etc/cron.d/librenms\n).\n Just add a number after \npoller-wrapper.py\n, as in the below example:\n\n\n/opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 12 \n /dev/null 2\n1\n\n\n\nCreate the cronjob\n\n\ncp librenms.nonroot.cron /etc/cron.d/librenms\n\n\n\nCopy logrotate config\n\n\nLibreNMS keeps logs in \n/opt/librenms/logs\n. Over time these can become large and be rotated out.  To rotate out the old logs you can use the provided logrotate config file:\n\n\ncp misc/librenms.logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/librenms\n\n\n\nDaily Updates\n\n\nLibreNMS performs daily updates by default.  At 00:15 system time every day, a \ngit pull --no-edit --quiet\n is performed.  You can override this default by editing your \nconfig.php\n file.  Remove the comment (the \n#\n mark) on the line:\n\n\n#$config['update'] = 0;\n\n\n\nso that it looks like this:\n\n\n$config['update'] = 0;\n\n\n\nInstall complete\n\n\nPlease allow for 2-3 runs of the poller-wrapper for data to start appearing in the WebUI.\nIf you don't see data after this, please refer to the \nFAQ\n for assistance.\n\n\nThat's it!  You now should be able to log in to http://librenms.example.com/.  Please note that we have not covered HTTPS setup in this example, so your LibreNMS install is not secure by default.

Other functions needed for LibreNMS include \nexec,passthru,shell_exec,escapeshellarg,escapeshellcmd,proc_close,proc_open,popen\n.\n\n\nNext, add the following to \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/librenms.conf\n\n\nIf you are running Apache below version 2.2.18:\n\n\nVirtualHost *:80\n\n  DocumentRoot /opt/librenms/html/\n  ServerName  librenms.example.com\n  CustomLog /opt/librenms/logs/access_log combined\n  ErrorLog /opt/librenms/logs/error_log\n  AllowEncodedSlashes On\n  \nDirectory \n/opt/librenms/html/\n\n    AllowOverride All\n    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n  \n/Directory\n\n\n/VirtualHost\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are running Apache 2.2.18 or higher (current version in Centos 7 official repo):\n\n\nVirtualHost *:80\n\n  DocumentRoot /opt/librenms/html/\n  ServerName  librenms.example.com\n  CustomLog /opt/librenms/logs/access_log combined\n  ErrorLog /opt/librenms/logs/error_log\n  AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode\n  \nDirectory \n/opt/librenms/html/\n\n    AllowOverride All\n    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews\n    Require all granted\n  \n/Directory\n\n\n/VirtualHost\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the file \n/etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf\n exists, you will want to remove that as well unless you're familiar with \nName-based Virtual Hosts\n.\n\n\nrn /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf.bak\n\n\n\n\nUsing Nginx and PHP-FPM\n\n\nIf you choose to run Nginx, you will need to install necessary extra software and let it start on system boot.\n\n\nCentOS 6\n\n\n    yum install nginx php-fpm\n    chkconfig nginx on\n    chkconfig php-fpm on\n\n\n\n\nCentOS 7\n\n\n    yum install nginx php-fpm\n    systemctl enable nginx\n    systemctl enable php-fpm\n\n\n\n\nModify permissions and configuration for \nphp-fpm\n to use nginx credentials.\n\n\nmkdir /var/lib/php/session\nchown root:nginx /var/lib/php -R\nvim /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf      # At line #12: Change `listen` to `/var/run/php5-fpm.sock`\n                                # At line #39-41: Change the `user` and `group` to `nginx`\n\n\n\nAdd configuration for \nnginx\n at \n/etc/nginx/conf.d/librenms.conf\n with the following content:\n\n\nserver {\n listen      80;\n server_name librenms.example.com;\n root        /opt/librenms/html;\n index       index.php;\n access_log  /opt/librenms/logs/access_log;\n error_log   /opt/librenms/logs/error_log;\n location / {\n  try_files $uri $uri/ @librenms;\n }\n location ~ \\.php {\n  fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;\n  include fastcgi.conf;\n  fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\\.php)(/.+)$;\n  fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;\n }\n location ~ /\\.ht {\n  deny all;\n }\n location @librenms {\n  rewrite api/v0(.*)$ /api_v0.php/$1 last;\n  rewrite ^(.+)$ /index.php/$1 last;\n }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCloning\n\n\nYou can clone the repository via HTTPS or SSH.  In either case, you need to ensure the appropriate port (443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH) is open in the outbound direction for your server.\n\n\n    cd /opt\n    git clone https://github.com/librenms/librenms.git librenms\n    cd /opt/librenms\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: The recommended method of cloning a git repository is HTTPS.  If you would like to clone via SSH instead, use the command \ngit clone git@github.com:librenms/librenms.git librenms\n instead.\n\n\nPrepare the Web Interface\n\n\nTo prepare the web interface, you'll need to create and chown a directory as well as create an Apache vhost.\n\n\nFirst, create and chown the \nrrd\n directory and create the \nlogs\n directory\n\n\n    mkdir rrd logs\n    chown -R librenms:librenms /opt/librenms\n    chmod 775 rrd\n\n\n\n\nIf you're planing on running rrdcached, make sure that the path is also chmod'ed to 775 and chown'ed to librenms:librenms.\n\n\nSELinux\n\n\n\n\nif you're using SELinux (in Centos 7 this is the defualt) you need to allow web server user to write into logs directory.\nsemanage tool is a part of policycoreutils-python, so if don't have it, you can install it\n\nPlease note that running LibreNMS with SELinux is still experimental and we cannot guarantee that everything will be working fine for now.\n\n\n\n\n    yum install policycoreutils-python\n\n\n\n\n    semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/opt/librenms/logs(/.*)?'\n    semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t '/opt/librenms/logs(/.*)?'\n    restorecon -RFvv /opt/librenms/logs/\n\n\n\n\nSet selinux to allow httpd to sendmail\n\n\n    setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail=1\n\n\n\n\nStart the web-server:\n\n\nCentOS 6\n\n\n# For HTTPd (Apache):\nservice httpd restart\n\n# For Nginx:\nservice nginx restart\n\n\n\nCentOS 7\n\n\n# For HTTPd (Apache):\nsystemctl restart httpd\n\n# For Nginx:\nsystemctl restart nginx\n\n\n\nWeb Installer\n\n\nAt this stage you can launch the web installer by going to \nhttp://IP/install.php\n and follow the on-screen instructions. Alternatively if you want to continue the setup manually then perform the manual install steps. If you cannot reach the installer, stop here and solve that problem before proceeding. Afterwards, Add the following line to the end of \nconfig.php\n:\n\n\n$config['fping'] = \"/usr/sbin/fping\";\n\n\n\nManual Install\n\n\nYou may skip this section if the web installer succeeded.\n\n\n    cp config.php.default config.php\n    vi config.php\n\n\n\n\nChange the values to the right of the equal sign for lines beginning with \n$config[db_]\n to match your database information as previously configured.\n\n\nChange the value of \n$config['snmp']['community']\n from \npublic\n to whatever your default read-only SNMP community is.  If you have multiple existing communities in your environment, set it to the most common.\n\n\nAdd the following line to the end of \nconfig.php\n:\n\n\n$config['fping'] = \"/usr/sbin/fping\";\n\n\n\nImportant: Be sure you have no characters (including whitespace like: newlines, spaces, tabs, etc) outside of the \n?php?\n blocks. Your graphs will break otherwise and there will be no error messages to indicate otherwise!\n\n\nInitialize the database\n\n\nInitiate the follow database with the following command:\n\n\nphp build-base.php\n\n\n\nCreate admin user\n\n\nCreate the admin user - priv should be 10\n\n\nphp adduser.php \nname\n \npass\n 10 \nemail\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute your desired username, password and email address--and leave the angled brackets off.\n\n\nValidate your install\n\n\nAfter performing the manual install or web install, be sure to run validate.php as root in the librenms directory:\n\n\nphp validate.php\n\n\n\nThis will check your install to verify it is set up correctly.\n\n\nAdd localhost\n\n\nphp addhost.php localhost public v2c\n\n\n\nReplace \npublic\n to match what you set in \n/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf\n.  This command also assumes you are using SNMP v2c.  If you're using v3, there are additional steps (NOTE: instructions for SNMPv3 to come).\n\n\nDiscover localhost:\n\n\nphp discovery.php -h all\n\n\n\nCreate cronjob\n\n\nThe polling method used by LibreNMS is \npoller-wrapper.py\n, which was placed in the public domain by its author.  By default, the LibreNMS cronjob runs \npoller-wrapper.py\n with 16 threads.  The current LibreNMS recommendation is to use 4 threads per core.  The default if no thread count is \n16 threads\n.\n\n\nIf the thread count needs to be changed, you can do so by editing the cron file (\n/etc/cron.d/librenms\n).\n Just add a number after \npoller-wrapper.py\n, as in the below example:\n\n\n/opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 12 \n /dev/null 2\n1\n\n\n\nCreate the cronjob\n\n\ncp librenms.nonroot.cron /etc/cron.d/librenms\n\n\n\nCopy logrotate config\n\n\nLibreNMS keeps logs in \n/opt/librenms/logs\n. Over time these can become large and be rotated out.  To rotate out the old logs you can use the provided logrotate config file:\n\n\ncp misc/librenms.logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/librenms\n\n\n\nDaily Updates\n\n\nLibreNMS performs daily updates by default.  At 00:15 system time every day, a \ngit pull --no-edit --quiet\n is performed.  You can override this default by editing\nyour \nconfig.php\n file.  Remove the comment (the \n#\n mark) on the line:\n\n\n#$config['update'] = 0;\n\n\n\nso that it looks like this:\n\n\n$config['update'] = 0;\n\n\n\nInstall complete\n\n\nPlease allow for 2-3 runs of the poller-wrapper for data to start appearing in the WebUI.\nIf you don't see data after this, please refer to the \nFAQ\n for assistance.\n\n\nThat's it!  You now should be able to log in to http://librenms.example.com/.  Please note that we have not covered HTTPS setup in this example, so your LibreNMS install is not secure by default.  Please do not expose it to the public Internet unless you have configured HTTPS and taken appropriate web server hardening steps.\n\n\nIt would be great if you would consider opting into the stats system we have, please see \nthis page\n on what it is and how to enable it.",

Consider the following YAML:\n\n\ndiscovery: \n  - sysObjectId: foo\n  - \n    sysDescr: [ snafu, exodar ]\n    sysObjectId: bar\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is how the discovery array would look in PHP:\n\n\n[\n     [\n       \nsysObjectId\n =\n \nfoo\n,\n     ],\n     [\n       \nsysDescr\n =\n [\n         \nsnafu\n,\n         \nexodar\n,\n       ],\n       \nsysObjectId\n =\n \nbar\n,\n     ]\n]\n\n\n\n\nThe logic for the discovery is as follows:\n1. One of the first level items must match\n2. ALL of the second level items must match (sysObjectId, sysDescr)\n3. One of the third level items (foo, [snafu,exodar], bar) must match\n\n\nSo, considering the example:\n - \nsysObjectId: foo, sysDescr: ANYTHING\n matches\n - \nsysObjectId: bar, sysDescr: ANYTHING\n does not match\n - \nsysObjectId: bar, sysDescr: exodar\n matches \n - \nsysObjectId: bar, sysDescr: snafu\n matches \n\n\nPoller\n\n\nOS polling is done within \nincludes/polling/os/$os.inc.php\n and is where we detect certain values.\n\n\n?php\n\n$version = preg_replace('/[\\r\\n\\\n]+/', ' ', snmp_get($device, \nproductVersion.0\n, \n-OQv\n, \nPULSESECURE-PSG-MIB\n));\n$hardware = \nJuniper \n . preg_replace('/[\\r\\n\\\n]+/', ' ', snmp_get($device, \nproductName.0\n, \n-OQv\n, \nPULSESECURE-PSG-MIB\n));\n\n\n\n\n\n$version\n: The version of the OS running on the device.\n\n\n$hardware\n: The hardware version for the device. For example: 'WS-C3560X-24T-S'\n\n\n$features\n: Features for the device, for example a list of cards in the slots of a modular chassis.\n\n\n$serial\n: The main serial number of the device.\n\n\nMIBs\n\n\nIf the device has MIBs available and you use it in the detection then you can add these in. It is highly \nrecommended that you add mibs to a vendor specific directory. For instance HP mibs are in \nmibs/hp\n. Please \n ensure that these directories are specified in the yaml detection file, see \nmib_dir\n above.\n\n\nIcon and Logo\n\n\nIt is highly recommended to use SVG images where possible, these scale and provide a nice visual image for users \nwith HiDPI screens. If you can't find SVG images then please use png.\n\n\nCreate an SVG image of the icon and logo.  Legacy PNG bitmaps are also supported but look bad on HiDPI.\n- A vector image should not contain padding.\n\n- The file should not be larger than 20 Kb. Simplify paths to reduce large files.\n- Use plain SVG without gzip compression.\n- The SVG root element must not contain length and width attributes, only viewBox.\n\n\nIcon\n\n\n\n\nSave the icon SVG to \nhtml/images/os/$os.svg\n.\n\n\nIcons should look good when viewed at 32x32 px.\n\n\nSquare icons are preferred to full logos with text.\n\n\nRemove small ornaments that are almost not visible when displayed with 32px width (e.g. \u00ae or \u2122).\n\n\n\n\nLogo\n\n\n\n\nSave the logo SVG to \nhtml/images/logos/$os.svg\n.\n\n\nLogos can be any dimension, but often are wide and contain the company name.\n\n\nIf a logo is not present, the icon will be used.\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\nHints for \nInkscape\n:\n\n\n\n\nYou can open a PDF or EPS to extract the logo.\n\n\nUngroup elements to isolate the logo.\n\n\nUse \nPath -\n Simplify\n to simplify paths of large files.\n\n\nUse \nFile -\n Document Properties\u2026 -\n Resize page to content\u2026\n to remove padding.\n\n\nUse \nFile -\n Clean up document\n to remove unused gradients, patterns, or markers.\n\n\nUse \nFile -\n Save As -\n Plain SVG\n to save the final image.\n\n\n\n\nBy optimizing the SVG you can shrink the file size in some cases to less than 20 %.\n\nSVG Optimizer\n does a great job. There is also an \nonline version\n.\n\n\nThe final check\n\n\nDiscovery\n\n\n./discovery.php -h HOSTNAME\n\n\n\n\nPolling\n\n\n./poller.php -h HOSTNAME\n\n\n\n\nAt this step we should see all the values retrieved in LibreNMS.",
