Tokens To access any of the token end points you will be required to authenticate using a token. Tokens can be created directly from within the LibreNMS web interface by going to /api-access/ .

Endpoints Whilst this documentation will describe and show examples of the end points, we've designed the API so you should be able to traverse through it without knowing any of the available API routes. You can do this by first calling /api/v0 : curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: YOURAPITOKENHERE' https://librenms.org/api/v0 Output: { \"list_bgp\" : \"https://librenms.org/api/v0/bgp\" , ... \"edit_rule\" : \"https://librenms.org/api/v0/rules\" } Input Input to the API is done in three different ways, sometimes a combination two or three of these. Passing parameters via the api route. For example when obtaining a devices details you will pass the hostname of the device in the route: /api/v0/devices/:hostname . Passing parameters via the query string. For example you can list all devices on your install but limit the output to devices that are currently down: /api/v0/devices?type=down Passing data in via JSON, this will mainly be used when adding or updating information via the API, for instance adding a new device: curl -X POST -d '{\"hostname\":\"localhost.localdomain\",\"version\":\"v1\",\"community\":\"public\"}'-H 'X-Auth-Token: YOURAPITOKENHERE' https://librenms.org/api/v0/devices Output Output from the API currently is via two output types: JSON Most API responses will output json.

The aim for that is, if all parent devices are down, alert contacts will not receive redundant alerts for dependent devices. This is very useful when you have an outage, say in a branch office, where normally you'd receive hundreds of alerts, but when this is properly configured, you'd only receive an alert for the parent hosts. There are three ways to configure this feature. First one is from general settings of a device. The other two can be done in the 'Device Dependencies' item under 'Devices' menu. In this page, you can see all devices and with its parents. Clicking on the 'bin' icon will clear the dependency setting. Clicking on the 'pen' icon will let you edit or change the current setting for chosen device. There's also a 'Manage Device Dependencies' button on the top.

Rules can contain braces and Glues . Entities are provided from Table and Field from the database. For Example: ports.ifOperStatus . Conditions can be any of: Equals = Not Equals != In IN Not In NOT IN Begins with LIKE ('...%') Doesn't begin with NOT LIKE ('...%') Contains LIKE ('%...%') Doesn't Contain NOT LIKE ('%...%') Ends with LIKE ('%...')

If using macros as value you must include the macro name into backticks. i.e. `macros.past_60m` Note : Regex supports MySQL Regular expressions. Arithmetics are allowed as well. Options Here are some of the other options available when adding an alerting rule: Rule name: The name associated with the rule. Severity: How \"important\" the rule is. Max alerts: The maximum number of alerts sent for the event. -1 means unlimited. Delay: The amount of time in seconds to wait after a rule is matched before sending an alert out transport. Interval: The interval of time in seconds between alerts for an event until Max alert is reached. Mute alerts: Disables sending alert rule through alert transport. But will still show the alert in the Web UI. Invert match: Invert the matching rule (ie. alert on items that _don't match the rule). Recovery alerts: This will disable the recovery notification from being sent if turned off. Advanced On the Advanced tab, you can specify some additional options for the alert rule: Override SQL: Enable this if you using a custom query Query: The query to be used for the alert. An example of this would be an average rule for all CPUs over 10% SELECT * , AVG ( processors . processor_usage ) as cpu_avg FROM devices , processors WHERE ( devices . device_id = ? AND devices . device_id = processors . device_id ) AND ( devices . status = 1 && ( devices . disabled = 0 && devices . ignore = 0 )) = 1 HAVING AVG ( processors . processor_usage ) > 10 The 10 would then contain the average CPU usage value, you can change this value to be whatever you like. You will to need copy and paste this into the Alert Rule under Advanced then paste into Query box and switch the Override SQL. Procedure You can associate a rule to a procedure by giving the URL of the procedure when creating the rule. Only links like \"http://\" are supported, otherwise an error will be returned. Once configured, procedure can be opened from the Alert widget through the \"Open\" button, which can be shown/hidden from the widget configuration box.

You can find the older docs here Templates can be assigned to a single or a group of rules and can contain any kind of text. There is also a default template which is used for any rule that isn't associated with a template. This template can be found under Alert Templates page and can be edited. It also has an option revert it back to its default content. To attach a template to a rule just open the Alert Templates settings page, choose the template to assign and click the yellow button in the Actions column. In the appearing popupbox select the rule(s) you want the template to be assigned to and click the Attach button. You might hold down the CTRL key to select multiple rules at once. The templating engine in use is Laravel Blade. We will cover some of the basics here, however the official Laravel docs will have more information here Syntax Controls: if-else (Else can be omitted): @if ($alert->placeholder == 'value') Some Text @else Other Text @endif foreach-loop: @foreach ($alert->faults as $key => $value) Key: $key </br> alue: $value @endforeach Placeholders: Placeholders are special variables that if used within the template will be replaced with the relevant data, I.e: The device {{ $alert->hostname }} has been up for {{ $alert->uptime }} seconds would result in the following The device localhost has been up for 30344 seconds . When using placeholders to echo data, you need to wrap the placeholder in {{ }} . I.e {{ $alert->hostname }} .

Contacts will be gathered automatically and passed to the configured transports. By default the Contacts will be only gathered when the alert triggers and will ignore future changes in contacts for the incident. If you want contacts to be re-gathered before each dispatch, please set 'Updates to contact email addresses not honored' to Off in the WebUI. The contacts will always include the SysContact defined in the Device's SNMP configuration and also every LibreNMS user that has at least read -permissions on the entity that is to be alerted. At the moment LibreNMS only supports Port or Device permissions. You can exclude the SysContact by toggling 'Issue alerts to sysContact'.

With just one system you can monitor alerts from many other monitoring tools on a single screen. Example: Config Example API Endpoint http://alerta.example.com/api/alert Environment Production Apy key api key with write permission Alert state critical Recover state cleared Alertmanager Alertmanager is an alert handling software, initially developed for alert processing sent by Prometheus. It has built-in functionality for deduplicating, grouping and routing alerts based on configurable criteria. LibreNMS uses alert grouping by alert rule, which can produce an array of alerts of similar content for an array of hosts, whereas Alertmanager can group them by alert meta, ideally producing one single notice in case an issue occurs. It is possible to configure as much label values as required in Alertmanager Options section. Every label and it's value should be entered as a new line. Alertmanager Docs Example: Config Example Alertmanager URL http://alertmanager.example.com Alertmanager Options: source=librenms customlabel=value API The API transport allows to reach any service provider using POST, PUT or GET URLs (Like SMS provider, etc). It can be used in multiple ways: The same text built from the Alert template is available in the variable $msg , which can then be sent as an option to the API. Be carefull that HTTP GET requests are usually limited in length. The API-Option fields can be directly built from the variables defined in Template-Syntax but without the 'alert->' prefix. For instance, $alert->uptime is available as $uptime in the API transport The API-Headers allows you to add the headers that the api endpoint requires. The API-body allow sending data in the format required by the ApI endpoint. A few variables commonly used : Variable Description {{ $hostname }} Hostname {{ $sysName }} SysName {{ $sysDescr }} SysDescr {{ $os }} OS of device (librenms defined) {{ $type }} Type of device (librenms defined) {{ $ip }} IP Address {{ $hardware }} Hardware {{ $version }} Version {{ $uptime }} Uptime in seconds {{ $uptime_short }} Uptime in human-readable format {{ $timestamp }} Timestamp of alert {{ $description }} Description of device {{ $title }} Title (as built from the Alert Template) {{ $msg }} Body text (as built from the Alert Template) Example: The example below will use the API named sms-api of my.example.com and send the title of the alert to the provided number using the provided service key.

Rocket.chat Docs Example: Config Example Webhook URL https://rocket.url/api/v1/chat.postMessage Rocket.chat Options channel=#Alerting username=myname icon_url=http://someurl/image.gif icon_emoji=:smirk: Sensu The Sensu transport will POST an Event to the Agent API upon an alert being generated. It will be categorised (ok, warning or critical), and if you configure the alert to send recovery notifications, Sensu will also clear the alert automatically. No configuration is required - as long as you are running the Sensu Agent on your poller with the HTTP socket enabled on tcp/3031, LibreNMS will start generating Sensu events as soon as you create the transport. Acknowledging alerts within LibreNMS is not directly supported, but an annotation ( acknowledged ) is set, so a mutator or silence, or even the handler could be written to look for it directly in the handler. There is also an annotation ( generated-by ) set, to allow you to treat LibreNMS events differently from agent events. The 'shortname' option is a simple way to reduce the length of device names in configs. It replaces the last 3 domain components with single letters (e.g. websrv08.dc4.eu.corp.example.net gets shortened to websrv08.dc4.eu.cen). Limitations Only a single namespace is supported Sensu will reject rules with special characters - the Transport will attempt to fix up rule names, but it's best to stick to letters, numbers and spaces The transport only deals in absolutes - it ignores the got worse/got better states The agent will buffer alerts, but LibreNMS will not - if your agent is offline, alerts will be dropped There is no backchannel between Sensu and LibreNMS - if you make changes in Sensu to LibreNMS alerts, they'll be lost on the next event (silences will work) Example: Config Example Sensu Endpoint http://localhost:3031 Sensu Namespace eu-west Check Prefix lnms Source Key hostname Slack The Slack transport will POST the alert message to your Slack Incoming WebHook using the attachments option, you are able to specify multiple webhooks along with the relevant options to go with it.

To do this click on the following url: https://telegram.me/botfather Generate a new bot with the command \"/newbot\" BotFather is then asking for a username and a normal name. After that your bot is created and you get a HTTP token. (for more options for your bot type \"/help\") Add your bot to telegram with the following url: http://telegram.me/<botname> to use app or https://web.telegram.org/<botname> to use in web, and send some text to the bot. The BotFather should have responded with a token, copy your token code and go to the following page in chrome: https://api.telegram.org/bot<tokencode>/getUpdates (this could take a while so continue to refresh until you see something similar to below) You see a json code with the message you sent to the bot. Copy the Chat id. In this example that is \u201c-9787468\u201d within this example: \"message\":{\"message_id\":7,\"from\":\"id\":656556,\"first_name\":\"Joo\",\"last_name\":\"Doo\",\"username\":\"JohnDoo\"},\"chat\":{\"id\":-9787468,\"title\":\"Telegram Group\"},\"date\":1435216924,\"text\":\"Hi\"}}]} . Now create a new \"Telegram transport\" in LibreNMS (Global Settings -> Alerting Settings -> Telegram transport). Click on 'Add Telegram config' and put your chat id and token into the relevant box. If want to use a group to receive alerts, you need to pick the Chat ID of the group chat, and not of the Bot itself.

No configuration is required - as long as you are running the Sensu Agent on your poller with the HTTP socket enabled on tcp/3031, LibreNMS will start generating Sensu events as soon as you create the transport. Acknowledging alerts within LibreNMS is not directly supported, but an annotation ( acknowledged ) is set, so a mutator or silence, or even the handler could be written to look for it directly in the handler. There is also an annotation ( generated-by ) set, to allow you to treat LibreNMS events differently from agent events. The 'shortname' option is a simple way to reduce the length of device names in configs. It replaces the last 3 domain components with single letters (e.g. websrv08.dc4.eu.corp.example.net gets shortened to websrv08.dc4.eu.cen).","title":"Sensu"},{"location":"Alerting/Transports/#limitations","text":"Only a single namespace is supported Sensu will reject rules with special characters - the Transport will attempt to fix up rule names, but it's best to stick to letters, numbers and spaces The transport only deals in absolutes - it ignores the got worse/got better states The agent will buffer alerts, but LibreNMS will not - if your agent is offline, alerts will be dropped There is no backchannel between Sensu and LibreNMS - if you make changes in Sensu to LibreNMS alerts, they'll be lost on the next event (silences will work) Example: Config Example Sensu Endpoint http://localhost:3031 Sensu Namespace eu-west Check Prefix lnms Source Key hostname","title":"Limitations"},{"location":"Alerting/Transports/#slack","text":"The Slack transport will POST the alert message to your Slack Incoming WebHook using the attachments option, you are able to specify multiple webhooks along with the relevant options to go with it.

LibreNMS/ Classes that don't belong to the Laravel application belong in this directory, with a directory structure that matches the namespace. One class per file. See PSR-0 for details. html/ All legacy web accessible files are located here. New pages should follow the Laravel conventions. html/api_v0.php This is the API routing file which directs users to the correct API function based on the API endpoint call. html/index.php This is the main file which all links within LibreNMS are parsed through. It loads the majority of the relevant includes needed for the control panel to function. CSS and JS files are also loaded here. html/css/ All used CSS files are located here. html/css/custom/ This is a directory you can put custom css files into that won't interfere with auto updates html/js/ All used JS files are located here. includes/ This directory is quite big and contains all the files to make the cli and polling / discovery to work. This code is not currently accessible from Laravel code (intentionally). includes/discovery/, includes/polling/ All the discovery and polling code. The format is usually quite similar between discovery and polling. Both are made up of modules and the files within the relevant directories will match that module. So for instance if you want to update the os detection for a device, you would look in includes/discovery/os/ for a file named after the operating system such as linux: includes/discovery/linux.inc.php . Within here you would update or add support for newer OS'. This is the same for polling as well. includes/html/ This is where the majority of the website core files are located. These tend to be files that contain functions or often used code segments that can be included where needed rather than duplicating code. includes/html/forms/ This directory contains all of the files that are dynamically included from an ajax call to ajax/form. includes/html/api_functions.inc.php All of the functions and calls for the API are located here. includes/html/functions.inc.php This contains the majority of functions used throughout the standard web ui. includes/html/graphs/ This directory contains global and OS specific graph definitions. includes/html/reports/ In here is a list of of files that generate PDF reports available to the user. These are dynamically called in from html/pdf.php based on the report the user requests. includes/html/table/ This directory contains all of the ajax calls when generating the table of data. Most have been converted over so if you are planning to add a new table of data then you will do so here for all of the back end data calls. includes/html/pages/ This directory contains the URL structure when browsing the Web UI. So for example /devices/ is actually a call to includes/html/pages/devices.inc.php , /device/tab=ports/ is includes/html/pages/device/ports.inc.php . logs/ Contains the main librenms.log file by default, but can also contain your web server's logs, poller logs, and other items. mibs/ Here is where all of the mibs are located. Generally standard mibs should be in the root directory and specific vendor mibs should be in their own subdirectory. rrd/ Simple enough, this is where all of the rrd files are created.

It's quite simple to do this: Find the relevant directory to store your new document in, General, Support and Extensions are the most likely choices. Think of a descriptive name that's not too long, it should match what they may be looking for or describes the feature.

If you want to help develop LibreNMS and haven't really used Git before then this quick primer will help you get started. Some assumptions: Work is being done on a Linux box. LibreNMS is to be installed in /opt/librenms You have git installed. You have a GitHub Account . You are using ssh to connect to GitHub (If not, replace git@github.com:/yourusername/librenms.git with https://github.com/yourusername/librenms.git . Replace yourusername with your GitHub username. Fork LibreNMS repo You do this directly within GitHub , click the 'Fork' button near the top right. If you are associated with multiple organisations within GitHub then you might need to select which account you want to push the fork to. Prepare your git environment These are the defaults that are recommended. git config branch.autosetupmerge true git config --global user.name \"John Doe\" git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com Clone the repo Ok so now that you have forked the repo, you now need to clone it to your local install where you can then make the changes you need and submit them back. cd /opt/ git clone git@github.com:/yourusername/librenms.git Add Upstream repo To be able to pull in changes from the master LibreNMS repo you need to have it setup on your system. git remote add upstream https://github.com/librenms/librenms.git Now you have two configured remotes: origin: This is your repository, you can push and pull changes here. upstream: This is the main LibreNMS repository and you can only pull changes. Workflow guide As you become more familiar you may find a better workflow that fits your needs, until then this should be a safe workflow for you to follow. Before you start work on a new branch / feature. Make sure you are up to date. cd /opt/librenms git checkout master git pull upstream master git push origin master At this stage it's worth pointing out that we have some standard checks that are performed when you submit a pull request, you can run these checks yourself to be sure no issues are present in your pull request. Now, create a new branch to do you work on. It's important that you do this as you are then able to work on more than one feature at a time and submit them as pull requests individually. If you did all your work in the master branch then it gets a bit messy! You need to give your branch a name. If an issue is open (or closed on GitHub) then you can use that, in this example if the issue number is 123 then we will use issue-123. If a post exists on the community forum then you can use the post id like community-123. You're also welcome to use any arbitrary name for your branch but try and make it relevant to what the branch is. git checkout -b issue-123 Now, code away. Make the changes you need, test, change and test again :) When you are ready to submit the updates as a pull request then commit away. git add path/to/new/files/or/folders git commit -a -m 'Added feature to do X, Y and Z' git push origin issue-123 If you need to rebase against master then you can do this with: git pull upstream master git push origin issue-123 If after do this you get some merge conflicts then you need to resolve these before carrying on. Please try to squash all commits into one, this isn't essential as we can do this when we merge but it would be helpful to do this before you submit your pull request. Now you will be ready to submit a pull request from within GitHub. To do this, go to your GitHub page for the LibreNMS repo. Now select the branch you have just been working on (issue-123) from the drop down to the left and then click 'Pull Request'. Fill in the details to describe the work you have done and click 'Create pull request'. Thanks for your first pull request :) Ok, that should get you started on the contributing path.

Before you start work on a new branch / feature. Make sure you are up to date. cd /opt/librenms git checkout master git pull upstream master git push origin master At this stage it's worth pointing out that we have some standard checks that are performed when you submit a pull request, you can run these checks yourself to be sure no issues are present in your pull request. Now, create a new branch to do you work on. It's important that you do this as you are then able to work on more than one feature at a time and submit them as pull requests individually. If you did all your work in the master branch then it gets a bit messy! You need to give your branch a name. If an issue is open (or closed on GitHub) then you can use that, in this example if the issue number is 123 then we will use issue-123. If a post exists on the community forum then you can use the post id like community-123. You're also welcome to use any arbitrary name for your branch but try and make it relevant to what the branch is. git checkout -b issue-123 Now, code away. Make the changes you need, test, change and test again :) When you are ready to submit the updates as a pull request then commit away. git add path/to/new/files/or/folders git commit -a -m 'Added feature to do X, Y and Z' git push origin issue-123 If you need to rebase against master then you can do this with: git pull upstream master git push origin issue-123 If after do this you get some merge conflicts then you need to resolve these before carrying on. Please try to squash all commits into one, this isn't essential as we can do this when we merge but it would be helpful to do this before you submit your pull request. Now you will be ready to submit a pull request from within GitHub. To do this, go to your GitHub page for the LibreNMS repo. Now select the branch you have just been working on (issue-123) from the drop down to the left and then click 'Pull Request'.

Currently we have support for the following health metrics along with the values we expect to see the data in: Class Measurement airflow cfm ber ratio charge % chromatic_dispersion ps/nm cooling W count # current A dbm dBm delay s eer eer fanspeed rpm frequency Hz humidity % load % loss % power W power_consumed kWh power_factor ratio pressure kPa quality_factor dB runtime Min signal dBm snr SNR state # temperature C voltage V waterflow l/m Simple health discovery We have support for defining health / sensor discovery using YAML files so that you don't need to know how to write PHP. Please note that DISPLAY-HINTS are disabled so ensure you use the correct divisor / multiplier if applicable. All yaml files are located in includes/definitions/discovery/$os.yaml . Defining the information here is not always possible and is heavily reliant on vendors being sensible with the MIBs they generate. Only snmp walks are supported and you must provide a sane table that can be traversed and contains all of the data you need. We will use netbotz as an example here. includes/definitions/discovery/netbotz.yaml mib : NETBOTZV2-MIB modules : sensors : airflow : options : skip_value_lt : 0 data : - oid : airFlowSensorTable value : airFlowSensorValue divisor : 10 num_oid : '.1.3.6.1.4.1.5528.100.4.1.5.1.2.{{ $index }}' descr : '{{ $airFlowSensorLabel }}' index : 'airFlowSensorValue.{{ $index }}' At the top you can define one or more mibs to be used in the lookup of data: mib: NETBOTZV2-MIB For use of multiple MIB files separate them with a colon: mib: NETBOTZV2-MIB:SECOND-MIB For data: you have the following options: The only sensor we have defined here is airflow. The available options are as follows: oid (required): This is the name of the table you want to do the snmp walk on. value (optional): This is the key within the table that contains the value. If not provided willuse oid num_oid (required): This is the numerical OID that contains value . This should always include {{ $index }} . snmptranslate -On can help figure out the number. In case the index is a string, {{ $index_string }} can be used instead. divisor (optional): This is the divisor to use against the returned value . multiplier (optional): This is the multiplier to use against the returned value . low_limit (optional): This is the critical low threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. low_warn_limit (optional): This is the warning low threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. warn_limit (optional): This is the warning high threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. high_limit (optional): This is the critical high threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. descr (required): The visible label for this sensor. It can be a key with in the table or a static string, optionally using {{ index }} . group (optional): Groups sensors together under in the webui, displaying this text. Not specifying this will put the sensors in the default group. index (optional): This is the index value we use to uniquely identify this sensor. {{ $index }} will be replaced by the index from the snmp walk. skip_values (optional): This is an array of values we should skip over (see note below). skip_value_lt (optional): If sensor value is less than this, skip the discovery. skip_value_gt (optional): If sensor value is greater than this, skip the discovery. entPhysicalIndex (optional): If the sensor belongs to a physical entity then you can specify the index here. entPhysicalIndex_measured (optional): If the sensor belongs to a physical entity then you can specify the entity type here. user_func (optional): You can provide a function name for the sensors value to be processed through (i.e. Convert fahrenheit to celsius use fahrenheit_to_celsius ) For options: you have the following available: divisor : This is the divisor to use against the returned value . multiplier : This is the multiplier to use against the returned value . skip_values : This is an array of values we should skip over (see note below). skip_value_lt : If sensor value is less than this, skip the discovery. skip_value_gt : If sensor value is greater than this, skip the discovery. Multiple variables can be used in the sensors definition. The syntax is {{ $variable }} . Any oid in the current table can be used, as well as pre_cached data. The index ($index) and the sub_indexes (in case the oid is indexed multiple times) are also available: if $index=\"1.20\", then $subindex0=\"1\" and $subindex1=\"20\". skip_values can also compare items within the OID table against values. The index of the sensor is used to retrieve the value from the OID, unless a target index is appended to the OID. Comparisons behave on a logical OR basis when chained, so only one of them needs to be matched for that particular sensor to be skipped during discovery. An example of this is below: skip_values : - oid : sensUnit op : '!=' value : 4 - oid : sensConfig.0 op : '!=' value : 1 op can be any of the following operators : =, !=, ==, !==, <=, >=, <, >, starts, ends, contains, regex, in_array, not_starts, not_ends, not_contains, not_regex, not_in_array, exists Example: skip_values : - oid : sensorName op : 'not_in_array' value : [ 'sensor1' , 'sensor2' ] skip_values : - oid : sensorOptionalOID op : 'exists' value : false If you aren't able to use yaml to perform the sensor discovery, you will most likely need to use Advanced health discovery. Advanced health discovery If you can't use the yaml files as above, then you will need to create the discovery code in php. The directory structure for sensor information is includes/discovery/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php . The format of all of the sensors follows the same code format which is to collect sensor information via SNMP and then call the discover_sensor() function; with the exception of state sensors which requires additional code. Sensor information is commonly found in an ENTITY mib supplied by device's vendor in the form of a table. Other mib tables may be used as well. Sensor information is first collected by includes/discovery/sensors/pre_cache/$os.inc.php . This program will pull in data from mib tables into a $pre_cache array that can then be used in includes/discovery/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php to extract specific values which are then passed to discover_sensor() . discover_sensor() Accepts the following arguments: &$valid = This is always $valid['sensor'], do not pass any other values. $class = Required. This is the sensor class from the table above (i.e humidity). $device = Required. This is the $device array. $oid = Required. This must be the numerical OID for where the data can be found, i.e .1.2.3.4.5.6.7.0 $index = Required. This must be unique for this sensor class, device and type. Typically it's the index from the table being walked or it could be the name of the OID if it's a single value. $type = Required. This should be the OS name, i.e pulse. $descr = Required. This is a descriptive value for the sensor. Some devices will provide names to use. $divisor = Defaults to 1. This is used to divided the returned value. $multiplier = Defaults to 1. This is used to multiply the returned value. $low_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the low threshold limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report out range sensors. $low_warn_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the low warning limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report near out of range sensors. $warn_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the high warning limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report near out of range sensors. $high_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the high limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report out range sensors. $current = Defaults to null. Can be used to set the current value on discovery. Poller will update this on the next poll cycle anyway. $poller_type = Defaults to snmp. Things like the unix-agent can set different values but for the most part this should be left as snmp. $entPhysicalIndex = Defaults to null. Sets the entPhysicalIndex to be used to look up further hardware if available. $entPhysicalIndex_measured = Defaults to null. Sets the type of entPhysicalIndex used, i.e ports. $user_func = Defaults to null. You can provide a function name for the sensors value to be processed through (i.e. Convert fahrenheit to celsius use fahrenheit_to_celsius ) $group = Defaults to null. Groups sensors together under in the webui, displaying this text. For the majority of devices, this is all that's required to add support for a sensor. Polling is done based on the data gathered using discover_sensor() . If custom polling is needed then the file format is similar to discovery: includes/polling/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php . Whilst it's possible to perform additional snmp queries within polling this should be avoided where possible. The value for the OID is already available as $sensor_value . Graphing is performed automatically for sensors, no custom graphing is required or supported. Adding a new sensor class You will need to add code for your new sensor class in the following existing files: app/Models/Sensor.php : add a free icon from Font Awesome in the $icons array. doc/Developing/os/Health-Information.md : documentation for every sensor class is mandatory. includes/discovery/sensors.inc.php : add the sensor class to the $run_sensors array. includes/discovery/functions.inc.php : optional - if sensible low_limit and high_limit values are guessable when a SNMP-retrievable threshold is not available, add a case for the sensor class to the sensor_limit() and/or sensor_low_limit() functions.

In this example we will be collecting optical power level (dBm) from Adva FSP150CC family MetroE devices. This example will assume an understanding of SNMP and MIBs. First we setup includes/discovery/sensors/pre_cache/adva_fsp150.inc as shown below. The first line walks the cmEntityObject table to get information about the chassis and line cards. From this information we extract the model type which will identify which tables in the CM-Facility-Mib the ports are populated in. The program then reads the appropriate table into the $pre_cache array adva_fsp150_ports . This array will have OID indexies for each port, which we will use later to identify our sensor OIDs. $pre_cache['adva_fsp150'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEntityObjects', [], 'CM-ENTITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); $neType = $pre_cache['adva_fsp150'][1]['neType']; if ($neType == 'ccxg116pro') { $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEthernetTrafficPortTable', $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'], 'CM-FACILITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); } else { $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEthernetNetPortTable', $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'], 'CM-FACILITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEthernetAccPortTable', $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'], 'CM-FACILITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); } Next we are going to build our sensor discovery code. These are optical readings, so the file will be created as the dBm sensor type in includes/discover/sensors/dbm/adva_fsp150.inc.php . Below is a snippet of the code: foreach ($pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] as $index => $entry) { if ($entry['cmEthernetTrafficPortMediaType'] == 'fiber') { //Discover received power level $oidRx = '.1.3.6.1.4.1.2544.1.12.5.1.21.1.34.' . $index . '.3'; $oidTx = '.1.3.6.1.4.1.2544.1.12.5.1.21.1.33.' . $index . '.3'; $currentRx = snmp_get($device, $oidRx, '-Oqv', 'CM-PERFORMANCE-MIB', '/opt/librenms/mibs/adva'); $currentTx = snmp_get($device, $oidTx, '-Oqv', 'CM-PERFORMANCE-MIB', '/opt/librenms/mibs/adva'); if ($currentRx != 0 || $currentTx != 0) { $entPhysicalIndex = $entry['cmEthernetTrafficPortIfIndex']; $entPhysicalIndex_measured = 'ports'; $descrRx = dbFetchCell('SELECT `ifName` FROM `ports` WHERE `ifIndex`= ? AND `device_id` = ?', [$entry['cmEthernetTrafficPortIfIndex'], $device['device_id']]) . ' Rx Power'; discover_sensor( $valid['sensor'], 'dbm', $device, $oidRx, 'cmEthernetTrafficPortStatsOPR.' . $index, 'adva_fsp150', $descrRx, $divisor, $multiplier, null, null, null, null, $currentRx, 'snmp', $entPhysicalIndex, $entPhysicalIndex_measured ); $descrTx = dbFetchCell('SELECT `ifName` FROM `ports` WHERE `ifIndex`= ? AND `device_id` = ?', [$entry['cmEthernetTrafficPortIfIndex'], $device['device_id']]) . ' Tx Power'; discover_sensor( $valid['sensor'], 'dbm', $device, $oidTx, 'cmEthernetTrafficPortStatsOPT.' . $index, 'adva_fsp150', $descrTx, $divisor, $multiplier, null, null, null, null, $currentTx, 'snmp', $entPhysicalIndex, $entPhysicalIndex_measured ); } } } First the program will loop through each port's index value. In the case of Advas, the ports are names Ethernet 1-1-1-1, 1-1-1-2, etc, and they are indexed as oid.1.1.1.1, oid.1.1.1.2, etc in the mib. Next the program checks which table the port exists in and that the connector type is 'fiber'. There are other port tables in the full code that were ommitted from the example for brevity. Copper media won't have optical readings, so if the media type isn't fiber we skip discovery for that port. The next two lines build the OIDs for getting the optical receive and transmit values using the $index for the port. Using the OIDs the program gets the current receive and transmit values ($currentRx and $currentTx repectively) to verify the values are not 0. Not all SFPs collect digital optical monitoring (DOM) data, in the case of Adva the value of both transmit and recieve will be 0 if DOM is not available. While 0 is a valid value for optical power, its extremely unlikely that both will be 0 if DOM is present. If DOM is not available, then the program stops discovery for that port. Note that while this is the case with Adva, other vendors may differ in how they handle optics that do not supply DOM. Please check your vendor's mibs. Next the program assigns the values of $entPhysicalIndex and $entPhysicalIndex_measured. In this case $entPhysicalIndex is set to the value of the cmEthernetTrafficPortIfIndex so that it is associated with port. This will also allow the sensor graphs to show up on the associated port's page in the GUI in addition to the Health page. Following that the program uses a database call to get the description of the port which will be used as the title for the graph in the GUI. Lastly the program calls discover_sensor() and passes the information collected in the previous steps. The null values are for low, low warning, high, and high warning values, which are not collected in the Adva's MIB. You can manually run discovery to verify the code works by running ./discovery.php -h $device_id -m sensors . You can use -v to see what calls are being used during discovery and -d to see debug output. In the output under #### Load disco module sensors #### you can see a list of sensors types.

Defining the information here is not always possible and is heavily reliant on vendors being sensible with the MIBs they generate. Only snmp walks are supported and you must provide a sane table that can be traversed and contains all of the data you need. We will use netbotz as an example here. includes/definitions/discovery/netbotz.yaml mib : NETBOTZV2-MIB modules : sensors : airflow : options : skip_value_lt : 0 data : - oid : airFlowSensorTable value : airFlowSensorValue divisor : 10 num_oid : '.1.3.6.1.4.1.5528.100.4.1.5.1.2.{{ $index }}' descr : '{{ $airFlowSensorLabel }}' index : 'airFlowSensorValue.{{ $index }}' At the top you can define one or more mibs to be used in the lookup of data: mib: NETBOTZV2-MIB For use of multiple MIB files separate them with a colon: mib: NETBOTZV2-MIB:SECOND-MIB For data: you have the following options: The only sensor we have defined here is airflow.

If not provided willuse oid num_oid (required): This is the numerical OID that contains value . This should always include {{ $index }} . snmptranslate -On can help figure out the number. In case the index is a string, {{ $index_string }} can be used instead. divisor (optional): This is the divisor to use against the returned value . multiplier (optional): This is the multiplier to use against the returned value . low_limit (optional): This is the critical low threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. low_warn_limit (optional): This is the warning low threshold that value should be (used in alerting). If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. warn_limit (optional): This is the warning high threshold that value should be (used in alerting).

If an OID is specified then divisor / multiplier are used. descr (required): The visible label for this sensor. It can be a key with in the table or a static string, optionally using {{ index }} . group (optional): Groups sensors together under in the webui, displaying this text. Not specifying this will put the sensors in the default group. index (optional): This is the index value we use to uniquely identify this sensor. {{ $index }} will be replaced by the index from the snmp walk. skip_values (optional): This is an array of values we should skip over (see note below). skip_value_lt (optional): If sensor value is less than this, skip the discovery. skip_value_gt (optional): If sensor value is greater than this, skip the discovery. entPhysicalIndex (optional): If the sensor belongs to a physical entity then you can specify the index here. entPhysicalIndex_measured (optional): If the sensor belongs to a physical entity then you can specify the entity type here. user_func (optional): You can provide a function name for the sensors value to be processed through (i.e. Convert fahrenheit to celsius use fahrenheit_to_celsius ) For options: you have the following available: divisor : This is the divisor to use against the returned value . multiplier : This is the multiplier to use against the returned value . skip_values : This is an array of values we should skip over (see note below). skip_value_lt : If sensor value is less than this, skip the discovery. skip_value_gt : If sensor value is greater than this, skip the discovery. Multiple variables can be used in the sensors definition. The syntax is {{ $variable }} . Any oid in the current table can be used, as well as pre_cached data. The index ($index) and the sub_indexes (in case the oid is indexed multiple times) are also available: if $index=\"1.20\", then $subindex0=\"1\" and $subindex1=\"20\". skip_values can also compare items within the OID table against values. The index of the sensor is used to retrieve the value from the OID, unless a target index is appended to the OID. Comparisons behave on a logical OR basis when chained, so only one of them needs to be matched for that particular sensor to be skipped during discovery. An example of this is below: skip_values : - oid : sensUnit op : '!=' value : 4 - oid : sensConfig.0 op : '!=' value : 1 op can be any of the following operators : =, !=, ==, !==, <=, >=, <, >, starts, ends, contains, regex, in_array, not_starts, not_ends, not_contains, not_regex, not_in_array, exists Example: skip_values : - oid : sensorName op : 'not_in_array' value : [ 'sensor1' , 'sensor2' ] skip_values : - oid : sensorOptionalOID op : 'exists' value : false If you aren't able to use yaml to perform the sensor discovery, you will most likely need to use Advanced health discovery.","title":"Simple health discovery"},{"location":"Developing/os/Health-Information/#advanced-health-discovery","text":"If you can't use the yaml files as above, then you will need to create the discovery code in php. The directory structure for sensor information is includes/discovery/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php . The format of all of the sensors follows the same code format which is to collect sensor information via SNMP and then call the discover_sensor() function; with the exception of state sensors which requires additional code. Sensor information is commonly found in an ENTITY mib supplied by device's vendor in the form of a table. Other mib tables may be used as well. Sensor information is first collected by includes/discovery/sensors/pre_cache/$os.inc.php . This program will pull in data from mib tables into a $pre_cache array that can then be used in includes/discovery/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php to extract specific values which are then passed to discover_sensor() . discover_sensor() Accepts the following arguments: &$valid = This is always $valid['sensor'], do not pass any other values. $class = Required. This is the sensor class from the table above (i.e humidity). $device = Required. This is the $device array. $oid = Required. This must be the numerical OID for where the data can be found, i.e .1.2.3.4.5.6.7.0 $index = Required. This must be unique for this sensor class, device and type. Typically it's the index from the table being walked or it could be the name of the OID if it's a single value. $type = Required. This should be the OS name, i.e pulse. $descr = Required. This is a descriptive value for the sensor. Some devices will provide names to use. $divisor = Defaults to 1. This is used to divided the returned value. $multiplier = Defaults to 1. This is used to multiply the returned value. $low_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the low threshold limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report out range sensors. $low_warn_limit = Defaults to null. Sets the low warning limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report near out of range sensors. $warn_limit = Defaults to null.

Sets the high limit for the sensor, used in alerting to report out range sensors. $current = Defaults to null. Can be used to set the current value on discovery. Poller will update this on the next poll cycle anyway. $poller_type = Defaults to snmp. Things like the unix-agent can set different values but for the most part this should be left as snmp. $entPhysicalIndex = Defaults to null.

Groups sensors together under in the webui, displaying this text. For the majority of devices, this is all that's required to add support for a sensor. Polling is done based on the data gathered using discover_sensor() . If custom polling is needed then the file format is similar to discovery: includes/polling/sensors/$class/$os.inc.php .

In this example we will be collecting optical power level (dBm) from Adva FSP150CC family MetroE devices. This example will assume an understanding of SNMP and MIBs. First we setup includes/discovery/sensors/pre_cache/adva_fsp150.inc as shown below. The first line walks the cmEntityObject table to get information about the chassis and line cards. From this information we extract the model type which will identify which tables in the CM-Facility-Mib the ports are populated in. The program then reads the appropriate table into the $pre_cache array adva_fsp150_ports . This array will have OID indexies for each port, which we will use later to identify our sensor OIDs. $pre_cache['adva_fsp150'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEntityObjects', [], 'CM-ENTITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); $neType = $pre_cache['adva_fsp150'][1]['neType']; if ($neType == 'ccxg116pro') { $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEthernetTrafficPortTable', $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'], 'CM-FACILITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); } else { $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEthernetNetPortTable', $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'], 'CM-FACILITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] = snmpwalk_cache_multi_oid($device, 'cmEthernetAccPortTable', $pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'], 'CM-FACILITY-MIB', null, '-OQUbs'); } Next we are going to build our sensor discovery code. These are optical readings, so the file will be created as the dBm sensor type in includes/discover/sensors/dbm/adva_fsp150.inc.php . Below is a snippet of the code: foreach ($pre_cache['adva_fsp150_ports'] as $index => $entry) { if ($entry['cmEthernetTrafficPortMediaType'] == 'fiber') { //Discover received power level $oidRx = '.1.3.6.1.4.1.2544.1.12.5.1.21.1.34.' . $index . '.3'; $oidTx = '.1.3.6.1.4.1.2544.1.12.5.1.21.1.33.' . $index . '.3'; $currentRx = snmp_get($device, $oidRx, '-Oqv', 'CM-PERFORMANCE-MIB', '/opt/librenms/mibs/adva'); $currentTx = snmp_get($device, $oidTx, '-Oqv', 'CM-PERFORMANCE-MIB', '/opt/librenms/mibs/adva'); if ($currentRx != 0 || $currentTx != 0) { $entPhysicalIndex = $entry['cmEthernetTrafficPortIfIndex']; $entPhysicalIndex_measured = 'ports'; $descrRx = dbFetchCell('SELECT `ifName` FROM `ports` WHERE `ifIndex`= ? AND `device_id` = ?', [$entry['cmEthernetTrafficPortIfIndex'], $device['device_id']]) . ' Rx Power'; discover_sensor( $valid['sensor'], 'dbm', $device, $oidRx, 'cmEthernetTrafficPortStatsOPR.' . $index, 'adva_fsp150', $descrRx, $divisor, $multiplier, null, null, null, null, $currentRx, 'snmp', $entPhysicalIndex, $entPhysicalIndex_measured ); $descrTx = dbFetchCell('SELECT `ifName` FROM `ports` WHERE `ifIndex`= ? AND `device_id` = ?', [$entry['cmEthernetTrafficPortIfIndex'], $device['device_id']]) . ' Tx Power'; discover_sensor( $valid['sensor'], 'dbm', $device, $oidTx, 'cmEthernetTrafficPortStatsOPT.' . $index, 'adva_fsp150', $descrTx, $divisor, $multiplier, null, null, null, null, $currentTx, 'snmp', $entPhysicalIndex, $entPhysicalIndex_measured ); } } } First the program will loop through each port's index value. In the case of Advas, the ports are names Ethernet 1-1-1-1, 1-1-1-2, etc, and they are indexed as oid.1.1.1.1, oid.1.1.1.2, etc in the mib. Next the program checks which table the port exists in and that the connector type is 'fiber'. There are other port tables in the full code that were ommitted from the example for brevity. Copper media won't have optical readings, so if the media type isn't fiber we skip discovery for that port. The next two lines build the OIDs for getting the optical receive and transmit values using the $index for the port. Using the OIDs the program gets the current receive and transmit values ($currentRx and $currentTx repectively) to verify the values are not 0. Not all SFPs collect digital optical monitoring (DOM) data, in the case of Adva the value of both transmit and recieve will be 0 if DOM is not available. While 0 is a valid value for optical power, its extremely unlikely that both will be 0 if DOM is present. If DOM is not available, then the program stops discovery for that port. Note that while this is the case with Adva, other vendors may differ in how they handle optics that do not supply DOM. Please check your vendor's mibs. Next the program assigns the values of $entPhysicalIndex and $entPhysicalIndex_measured. In this case $entPhysicalIndex is set to the value of the cmEthernetTrafficPortIfIndex so that it is associated with port. This will also allow the sensor graphs to show up on the associated port's page in the GUI in addition to the Health page. Following that the program uses a database call to get the description of the port which will be used as the title for the graph in the GUI. Lastly the program calls discover_sensor() and passes the information collected in the previous steps. The null values are for low, low warning, high, and high warning values, which are not collected in the Adva's MIB. You can manually run discovery to verify the code works by running ./discovery.php -h $device_id -m sensors . You can use -v to see what calls are being used during discovery and -d to see debug output. In the output under #### Load disco module sensors #### you can see a list of sensors types. If there is a + a sensor is added, if there is a - one was deleted, and a . means no change. If there is nothing next to the sensor type then the sensor was not discovered.

These are specified in the discovery yaml includes/definitions/discovery/<os>.yaml or LibreNMS/OS/<os>.php if more complex collection is required. version The version of the OS running on the device. hardware The hardware version for the device.

It is highly recommended that you add mibs to a vendor specific directory. For instance HP mibs are in mibs/hp . Please ensure that these directories are specified in the yaml detection file, see mib_dir above. Icon and Logo It is highly recommended to use SVG images where possible, these scale and provide a nice visual image for users with HiDPI screens. If you can't find SVG images then please use png. Create an SVG image of the icon and logo. Legacy PNG bitmaps are also supported but look bad on HiDPI. A vector image should not contain padding. The file should not be larger than 20 Kb. Simplify paths to reduce large files. Use plain SVG without gzip compression. The SVG root element must not contain length and width attributes, only viewBox. Icon Save the icon SVG to html/images/os/$os.svg . Icons should look good when viewed at 32x32 px. Square icons are preferred to full logos with text. Remove small ornaments that are almost not visible when displayed with 32px width (e.g. \u00ae or \u2122). Logo Save the logo SVG to html/images/logos/$os.svg . Logos can be any dimension, but often are wide and contain the company name. If a logo is not present, the icon will be used. Hints Hints for Inkscape : You can open a PDF or EPS to extract the logo. Ungroup elements to isolate the logo. Use Path -> Simplify to simplify paths of large files. Use File -> Document Properties\u2026 -> Resize page to content\u2026 to remove padding. Use File -> Clean up document to remove unused gradients, patterns, or markers. Use File -> Save As -> Plain SVG to save the final image. By optimizing the SVG you can shrink the file size in some cases to less than 20 %. SVG Optimizer does a great job. There is also an online version .

Different applications support a variety of ways to collect data: 1) by direct connection to the application, 2) snmpd extend, or 3) the agent . The monitoring of applications could be added before or after the hosts have been added to LibreNMS. If multiple methods of collection are listed you only need to enable one. SNMP Extend When using the snmp extend method, the application discovery module will pick up which applications you have set up for monitoring automatically, even if the device is already in LibreNMS. The application discovery module is enabled by default for most *nix operating systems, but in some cases you will need to manually enable the application discovery module. SUDO One major thing to keep in mind when using SNMP extend is these run as the snmpd user that can be an unprivileged user. In these situations you need to use sudo. To test if you need sudo, first check the user snmpd is running as. Then test if you can run the extend script as that user without issue. For example if snmpd is running as 'Debian-snmp' and we want to run the extend for proxmox, we check that the following run without error: sudo -u Debian-snmp /usr/local/bin/proxmox If it doesn't work, then you will need to use sudo with the extend command. For the example above, that would mean adding the line below to the sudoers file: Debian-snmp ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/proxmox Finally we would need to add sudo to the extend command, which would look like that for proxmox: extend proxmox /usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/bin/proxmox Enable the application discovery module Edit the device for which you want to add this support Click on the Modules tab and enable the applications module. This will be automatically saved, and you should get a green confirmation pop-up message. After you have enabled the application module, it would be wise to then also enable which applications you want to monitor, in the rare case where LibreNMS does not automatically detect it. Note : Only do this if an application was not auto-discovered by LibreNMS during discovery and polling. Enable the application(s) to be discovered Go to the device you have just enabled the application module for. Click on the Applications tab and select the applications you want to monitor. This will also be automatically saved, and you should get a green confirmation pop-up message. Agent The unix-agent does not have a discovery module, only a poller module. That poller module is always disabled by default. It needs to be manually enabled if using the agent. Some applications will be automatically enabled by the unix-agent poller module. It is better to ensure that your application is enabled for monitoring. You can check by following the steps under the SNMP Extend heading.

In case you get a Permission Denied error, make sure you changed the ownership correctly. 5: Also be aware that this file is appended to each time rndc stats is called. Given this it is suggested you setup file rotation for it. Alternatively you can also set zero_stats to 1 in the config. 6: The script for this also requires the Perl module File::ReadBackwards . FreeBSD => p5-File-ReadBackwards CentOS/RedHat => perl-File-ReadBackwards Debian/Ubuntu => libfile-readbackwards-perl If it is not available, it can be installed by cpan -i File::ReadBackwards . 7: You may possibly need to configure the agent/extend script as well. The config file's path defaults to the same path as the script, but with .config appended. So if the script is located at /etc/snmp/bind , the config file will be /etc/snmp/bind.config . Alternatively you can also specify a config via -c $file . Anything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables are $variable=$value. Empty lines are ignored. Spaces and tabs at either the start or end of a line are ignored. Content of an example /etc/snmp/bind.config . Please edit with your own settings. rndc = The path to rndc. Default: /usr/bin/env rndc call_rndc = A 0/1 boolean on whether or not to call rndc stats. Suggest to set to 0 if using netdata. Default: 1 stats_file = The path to the named stats file. Default: /var/cache/bind/stats agent = A 0/1 boolean for if this is being used as a LibreNMS agent or not. Default: 0 zero_stats = A 0/1 boolean for if the stats file should be zeroed first. Default: 0 (1 if guessed) If you want to guess at the configuration, call the script with -g and it will print out what it thinks it should be.

So if the script is located at /etc/snmp/smart, the config file will be /etc/snmp/smart.config . Alternatively you can also specific a config via -c . Anything starting with a # is comment. The format for variables is $variable=$value. Empty lines are ignored. Spaces and tabes at either the start or end of a line are ignored. Any line with out a matched variable or # are treated as a disk. #This is a comment cache=/var/cache/smart smartctl=/usr/bin/env smartctl useSN=1 ada0 ada1 da5 /dev/da5 -d sat twl0,0 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,0 twl0,1 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,1 twl0,2 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,2 The variables are as below. cache = The path to the cache file to use. Default: /var/cache/smart smartctl = The path to use for smartctl. Default: /usr/bin/env smartctl useSN = If set to 1, it will use the disks SN for reporting instead of the device name. 1 is the default. 0 will use the device name. A disk line is can be as simple as just a disk name under /dev/. Such as in the config above The line \"ada0\" would resolve to \"/dev/ada0\" and would be called with no special argument. If a line has a space in it, everything before the space is treated as the disk name and is what used for reporting and everything after that is used as the argument to be passed to smartctl. If you want to guess at the configuration, call it with -g and it will print out what it thinks it should be. Restart snmpd on your host If you have a large number of more than one or two disks on a system, you should consider adding this to cron. Also make sure the cache file is some place it can be written to. */3 * * * * /etc/snmp/smart -u If your snmp agent runs as user \"snmp\", edit your sudo users (usually visudo ) and add at the bottom: snmp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/snmp/smart, /usr/bin/env smartctl and modify your snmpd.conf file accordingly: extend smart /usr/bin/sudo /etc/snmp/smart The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of the page.

If you set useSN to 1, it is worth noting that you will loose history(not able to access it from the web interface) for that device each time you change it. You will also need to run camcontrol or the like on said server to figure out what device actually corresponds with that serial number. Also if the system you are using uses non-static device naming based on bus information, it may be worthwhile just using the SN as the device ID is going to be irrelevant in that case. Squid SNMP Proxy 1: Enable SNMP for Squid like below, if you have not already, and restart it. acl snmppublic snmp_community public snmp_port 3401 snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost snmp_access deny all 2: Restart squid on your host. 3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add, making sure you have the same community, host, and port as above: proxy -v 2c -c public 127.0.0.1:3401 1.3.6.1.4.1.3495 For more advanced information on Squid and SNMP or setting up proxying for net-snmp, please see the links below. http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/Snmp http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/Snmpd_proxy TinyDNS aka djbdns Agent Install the agent on this device if it isn't already and copy the tinydns script to /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/ Note : We assume that you use DJB's Daemontools to start/stop tinydns.

Any line with out a matched variable or # are treated as a disk. #This is a comment cache=/var/cache/smart smartctl=/usr/bin/env smartctl useSN=1 ada0 ada1 da5 /dev/da5 -d sat twl0,0 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,0 twl0,1 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,1 twl0,2 /dev/twl0 -d 3ware,2 The variables are as below. cache = The path to the cache file to use. Default: /var/cache/smart smartctl = The path to use for smartctl. Default: /usr/bin/env smartctl useSN = If set to 1, it will use the disks SN for reporting instead of the device name. 1 is the default. 0 will use the device name. A disk line is can be as simple as just a disk name under /dev/. Such as in the config above The line \"ada0\" would resolve to \"/dev/ada0\" and would be called with no special argument. If a line has a space in it, everything before the space is treated as the disk name and is what used for reporting and everything after that is used as the argument to be passed to smartctl. If you want to guess at the configuration, call it with -g and it will print out what it thinks it should be. Restart snmpd on your host If you have a large number of more than one or two disks on a system, you should consider adding this to cron. Also make sure the cache file is some place it can be written to. */3 * * * * /etc/snmp/smart -u If your snmp agent runs as user \"snmp\", edit your sudo users (usually visudo ) and add at the bottom: snmp ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /etc/snmp/smart, /usr/bin/env smartctl and modify your snmpd.conf file accordingly: extend smart /usr/bin/sudo /etc/snmp/smart The application should be auto-discovered as described at the top of the page.

If you set useSN to 1, it is worth noting that you will loose history(not able to access it from the web interface) for that device each time you change it. You will also need to run camcontrol or the like on said server to figure out what device actually corresponds with that serial number. Also if the system you are using uses non-static device naming based on bus information, it may be worthwhile just using the SN as the device ID is going to be irrelevant in that case.","title":"SNMP Extend"},{"location":"Extensions/Applications/#squid","text":"","title":"Squid"},{"location":"Extensions/Applications/#snmp-proxy","text":"1: Enable SNMP for Squid like below, if you have not already, and restart it. acl snmppublic snmp_community public snmp_port 3401 snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost snmp_access deny all 2: Restart squid on your host. 3: Edit your snmpd.conf file and add, making sure you have the same community, host, and port as above: proxy -v 2c -c public 127.0.0.1:3401 1.3.6.1.4.1.3495 For more advanced information on Squid and SNMP or setting up proxying for net-snmp, please see the links below. http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/Snmp http://www.net-snmp.org/wiki/index.php/Snmpd_proxy","title":"SNMP Proxy"},{"location":"Extensions/Applications/#tinydns-aka-djbdns","text":"","title":"TinyDNS aka djbdns"},{"location":"Extensions/Applications/#agent_11","text":"Install the agent on this device if it isn't already and copy the tinydns script to /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/ Note : We assume that you use DJB's Daemontools to start/stop tinydns.

Enable authentication module To enable a particular authentication module you need to set this up in config.php. Please note that only ONE module can be enabled. LibreNMS doesn't support multiple authentication mechanism at the same time. $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = \"mysql\" ; User levels and User account type 1: Normal User : You will need to assign device / port permissions for users at this level. 5: Global Read : Read only Administrator. 10: Administrator : This is a global read/write admin account. 11: Demo Account : Provides full read/write with certain restrictions (i.e can't delete devices). Note Oxidized configs can often contain sensitive data. Because of that only Administrator account type can see configs. Note for SELinux users When using SELinux on the LibreNMS server, you need to allow Apache (httpd) to connect LDAP/Active Directory server, this is disabled by default. You can use SELinux Booleans to allow network access to LDAP resources with this command: setsebool -P httpd_can_connect_ldap = 1 Testing authentication You can test authentication with this script: ./scripts/auth_test.php Enable debug output to troubleshoot issues MySQL Authentication Config option: mysql This is default option with LibreNMS so you should have already have the configuration setup in your environment file (.env). DB_HOST=HOSTNAME DB_DATABASE=DBNAME DB_USERNAME=DBUSER DB_PASSWORD=\"DBPASS\" Active Directory Authentication Config option: active_directory Install php_ldap or php7.0-ldap , making sure to install the same version as PHP. If you have issues with secure LDAP try setting $config['auth_ad_check_certificates'] to 0 , this will ignore certificate errors. Require actual membership of the configured groups If you set $config['auth_ad_require_groupmembership'] to 1, the authenticated user has to be a member of the specific group. Otherwise all users can authenticate, and will be either level 0 or you may set $config['auth_ad_global_read'] to 1 and all users will have read only access unless otherwise specified. Old account cleanup Cleanup of old accounts is done by checking the authlog. You will need to set the number of days when old accounts will be purged AUTOMATICALLY by daily.sh. Please ensure that you set the $config['authlog_purge'] value to be greater than $config['active_directory']['users_purge'] otherwise old users won't be removed. Sample configuration $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = 'active_directory' ; $config [ 'auth_ad_url' ] = 'ldaps://server.example.com' ; // Set server(s), space separated. Prefix with ldaps:// for ssl $config [ 'auth_ad_domain' ] = 'example.com' ; $config [ 'auth_ad_base_dn' ] = 'dc=example,dc=com' ; // groups and users must be under this dn $config [ 'auth_ad_check_certificates' ] = true ; // require a valid ssl certificate $config [ 'auth_ad_binduser' ] = 'examplebinduser' ; // bind user (non-admin) $config [ 'auth_ad_bindpassword' ] = 'examplepassword' ; // bind password $config [ 'auth_ad_timeout' ] = 5 ; // time to wait before giving up (or trying the next server) $config [ 'auth_ad_debug' ] = false ; // enable for verbose debug messages $config [ 'active_directory' ][ 'users_purge' ] = 30 ; // purge users who haven't logged in for 30 days. $config [ 'auth_ad_require_groupmembership' ] = true ; // false: allow all users to auth level 0 $config [ 'auth_ad_groups' ][ 'ad-admingroup' ][ 'level' ] = 10 ; // set the \"AD AdminGroup\" group to admin level $config [ 'auth_ad_groups' ][ 'ad-usergroup' ][ 'level' ] = 5 ; // set the \"AD UserGroup\" group to global read only level Replace ad-admingroup with your Active Directory admin-user group and ad-usergroup with your standard user group. It is highly suggested to create a bind user, otherwise \"remember me\", alerting users, and the API will not work. Active Directory redundancy You can set two Active Directory servers by editing the $config['auth_ad_url'] like this example: $config['auth_ad_url'] = \"ldaps://dc1.example.com ldaps://dc2.example.com\"; Active Directory LDAP filters You can add an LDAP filter to be ANDed with the builtin user filter ( (sAMAccountName=$username) ). The defaults are: $config['auth_ad_user_filter'] = \"(objectclass=user)\"; $config['auth_ad_group_filter'] = \"(objectclass=group)\"; This yields (&(objectclass=user)(sAMAccountName=$username)) for the user filter and (&(objectclass=group)(sAMAccountName=$group)) for the group filter. LDAP Authentication Config option: ldap Install php_ldap or php7.0-ldap , making sure to install the same version as PHP. Standard config $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = 'ldap' ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_server' ] = 'ldap.example.com' ; // Set server(s), space separated.

Useful if your users are in different OU. Bind username, if set, still user auth_ldap_suffix LDAP bind user (optional) If your ldap server does not allow anonymous bind, it is highly suggested to create a bind user, otherwise \"remember me\", alerting users, and the API will not work. $config [ 'auth_ldap_binduser' ] = 'ldapbind' ; // will use auth_ldap_prefix and auth_ldap_suffix #$config['auth_ldap_binddn'] = 'CN=John.Smith,CN=Users,DC=MyDomain,DC=com'; // overrides binduser $config [ 'auth_ldap_bindpassword' ] = 'password' ; LDAP server redundancy You can set two LDAP servers by editing the $config['auth_ldap_server'] like this example: $config['auth_ldap_server'] = \"ldaps://dir1.example.com ldaps://dir2.example.com\"; An example config setup for use with Jumpcloud LDAP as a service is: $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = \"ldap\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_version' ] = 3 ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_server' ] = \"ldap.jumpcloud.com\" ; #Set to ldaps://ldap.jumpcloud.com to enable LDAPS $config [ 'auth_ldap_port' ] = 389 ; #Set to 636 if using LDAPS $config [ 'auth_ldap_prefix' ] = \"uid=\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_suffix' ] = \",ou=Users,o={id},dc=jumpcloud,dc=com\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_groupbase' ] = \"ou=Users,o={id},dc=jumpcloud,dc=com\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_groupmemberattr' ] = \"member\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_groups' ] = [ '{group}' => [ 'level' => 10 ],]; $config [ 'auth_ldap_userdn' ] = true ; Replace {id} with the unique ID provided by Jumpcloud. Replace {group} with the unique group name created in Jumpcloud. This field is case sensitive. Note: If you have multiple user groups to define individual access levels replace the $config['auth_ldap_groups'] line with the following: $config [ 'auth_ldap_groups' ] = [ '{admin_group}' => [ 'level' => 10 ], '{global_readonly_group}' => [ 'level' => 5 ], ]; Radius Authentication Please note that a mysql user is created for each user the logs in successfully. User level 1 is assigned to those accounts so you will then need to assign the relevant permissions unless you set $config['radius']['userlevel'] to be something other than 1. $config [ 'radius' ][ 'hostname' ] = 'localhost' ; $config [ 'radius' ][ 'port' ] = '1812' ; $config [ 'radius' ][ 'secret' ] = 'testing123' ; $config [ 'radius' ][ 'timeout' ] = 3 ; $config [ 'radius' ][ 'users_purge' ] = 14 ; //Purge users who haven't logged in for 14 days. $config [ 'radius' ][ 'default_level' ] = 1 ; //Set the default user level when automatically creating a user. Old account cleanup Cleanup of old accounts is done by checking the authlog. You will need to set the number of days when old accounts will be purged AUTOMATICALLY by daily.sh. Please ensure that you set the $config['authlog_purge'] value to be greater than $config['radius']['users_purge'] otherwise old users won't be removed. HTTP Authentication Config option: http-auth LibreNMS will expect the user to have authenticated via your webservice already. At this stage it will need to assign a userlevel for that user which is done in one of two ways: A user exists in MySQL still where the usernames match up. A global guest user (which still needs to be added into MySQL: $config [ 'http_auth_guest' ] = \"guest\" ; This will then assign the userlevel for guest to all authenticated users. HTTP Authentication / AD Authorization Config option: ad-authorization This module is a combination of http-auth and active directory _ LibreNMS will expect the user to have authenticated via your webservice already (e.g. using Kerberos Authentication in Apache) but will use Active Directory lookups to determine and assign the userlevel of a user. The userlevel will be calculated by using AD group membership information as the active directory _ module does. The configuration is the same as for the active directory _ module with two extra, optional options: auth_ad_binduser and auth_ad_bindpassword. These should be set to a AD user with read capabilities in your AD Domain in order to be able to perform searches. If these options are omitted, the module will attempt an anonymous bind (which then of course must be allowed by your Active Directory server(s)). There is also one extra option for controlling user information caching: auth_ldap_cache_ttl. This option allows to control how long user information (user_exists, userid, userlevel) are cached within the PHP Session. The default value is 300 seconds. To disable this caching (highly discourage) set this option to 0. $config [ 'auth_ad_binduser' ] = \"ad_binduser\" ; $config [ 'auth_ad_bindpassword' ] = \"ad_bindpassword\" ; $config [ 'auth_ldap_cache_ttl' ] = 300 ; HTTP Authentication / LDAP Authorization Config option: ldap-authorization This module is a combination of http-auth and ldap LibreNMS will expect the user to have authenticated via your webservice already (e.g. using Kerberos Authentication in Apache) but will use LDAP to determine and assign the userlevel of a user. The userlevel will be calculated by using LDAP group membership information as the ldap module does. The configuration is the same as for the ldap module with one extra option: auth_ldap_cache_ttl. This option allows to control how long user information (user_exists, userid, userlevel) are cached within the PHP Session. The default value is 300 seconds. To disabled this caching (highly discourage) set this option to 0. $config [ 'auth_ldap_cache_ttl' ] = 300 ; View/embedded graphs without being logged into LibreNMS $config [ 'allow_unauth_graphs_cidr' ] = array ( '127.0.0.1/32' ); $config [ 'allow_unauth_graphs' ] = true ; Single Sign-on The single sign-on mechanism is used to integrate with third party authentication providers that are managed outside of LibreNMS - such as ADFS, Shibboleth, EZProxy, BeyondCorp, and others. A large number of these methods use SAML the module has been written assuming the use of SAML, and therefore these instructions contain some SAML terminology, but it should be possible to use any software that works in a similar way. In order to make use of the single sign-on module, you need to have an Identity Provider up and running, and know how to configure your Relying Party to pass attributes to LibreNMS via header injection or environment variables. Setting these up is outside of the scope of this documentation. As this module deals with authentication, it is extremely careful about validating the configuration - if it finds that certain values in the configuration are not set, it will reject access rather than try and guess. Basic Configuration To get up and running, all you need to do is configure the following values: $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = \"sso\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'mode' ] = \"env\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_strategy' ] = \"static\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'static_level' ] = 10 ; This, along with the defaults, sets up a basic Single Sign-on setup that: Reads values from environment variables Automatically creates users when they're first seen Authomatically updates users with new values Gives everyone privilege level 10 This happens to mimic the behaviour of http-auth , so if this is the kind of setup you want, you're probably better of just going and using that mechanism. Security If there is a proxy involved (e.g. EZProxy, Azure AD Application Proxy, NGINX, mod_proxy) it's essential that you have some means in place to prevent headers being injected between the proxy and the end user, and also prevent end users from contacting LibreNMS directly. This should also apply to user connections to the proxy itself - the proxy must not be allowed to blindly pass through HTTP headers. mod security _ should be considered a minimum, with a full WAF being strongly recommended. This advice applies to the IDP too. The mechanism includes very basic protection, in the form of an IP whitelist with should contain the source addresses of your proxies: $config [ 'sso' ][ 'trusted_proxies' ] = [ '127.0.0.1/8' , '::1/128' , '192.0.2.0' , '2001:DB8::' ]; This configuration item should contain an array with a list of IP addresses or CIDR prefixes that are allowed to connect to LibreNMS and supply environment variables or headers. Advanced Configuration Options User Attribute If for some reason your relying party doesn't store the username in REMOTE USER _, you can override this choice. $config [ 'sso' ][ 'user_attr' ] = 'HTTP_UID' ; Note that the user lookup is a little special - normally headers are prefixed with HTTP_ , however this is not the case for remote user - it's a special case. If you're using something different you need to figure out of the HTTP_ prefix is required or not yourself. Automatic User Create/Update These are enabled by default: $config [ 'sso' ][ 'create_users' ] = true ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'update_users' ] = true ; If these are not enabled, user logins will be (somewhat silently) rejected unless an administrator has created the account in advance. Note that in the case of SAML federations, unless release of the users true identity has been negotiated with the IDP, the username (probably ePTID) is not likely to be predicable. Personalisation If the attributes are being populated, you can instruct the mechanism to add additional information to the user's database entry: $config [ 'sso' ][ 'email_attr' ] = \"mail\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'realname_attr' ] = \"displayName\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'descr_attr' ] = \"unscoped-affiliation Group Strategies Static As used above, static gives every single user the same privilege level. If you're working with a small team, or don't need access control, this is probably suitable. Attribute $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_strategy' ] = \"attribute\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'level_attr' ] = \"entitlement\" ; If your Relying Party is capable of calculating the necessary privilege level, you can configure the module to read the privilege number straight from an attribute. sso level_attr should contain the name of the attribute that the Relying Party exposes to LibreNMS - as long as sso mode is correctly set, the mechanism should find the value. Group Map This is the most flexible (and complex) way of assigning privileges. $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_strategy' ] = \"map\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_attr' ] = \"member\" ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_level_map' ] = [ 'librenms-admins' => 10 , 'librenms-readers' => 1 , 'librenms-billingcontacts' => 5 ]; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_delimiter' ] = ';' ; The mechanism expects to find a delimited list of groups within the attribute that sso group_attr _ points to. This should be an associative array of group name keys, with privilege levels as values. The mechanism will scan the list and find the highest privilege level that the user is entitled to, and assign that value to the user. This format may be specific to Shibboleth; other relying party software may need changes to the mechanism (e.g. mod auth_mellon _ may create pseudo arrays). There is an optional value for sites with large numbers of groups: $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_filter' ] = \"/librenms-(.*)/i\" ; This filter causes the mechanism to only consider groups matching a regular expression. Logout Behaviour LibreNMS has no capability to log out a user authenticated via Single Sign-On - that responsability falls to the Relying Party. If your Relying Party has a magic URL that needs to be called to end a session, you can configure LibreNMS to direct the user to it: $config [ 'post_logout_action' ] = '/Shibboleth.sso/Logout' ; This option functions independantly of the Single Sign-on mechanism. Complete Configuration This configuration works on my deployment with a Shibboleth relying party, injecting environment variables, with the IDP supplying a list of groups. $config [ 'auth_mechanism' ] = 'sso' ; $config [ 'auth_logout_handler' ] = '/Shibboleth.sso/Logout' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'mode' ] = 'env' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'create_users' ] = true ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'update_users' ] = true ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'realname_attr' ] = 'displayName' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'email_attr' ] = 'mail' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_strategy' ] = 'map' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_attr' ] = 'member' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_filter' ] = '/(librenms-.*)/i' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_delimiter' ] = ';' ; $config [ 'sso' ][ 'group_level_map' ] = [ 'librenms-demo' => 11 , 'librenms-globaladmin' => 10 , 'librenms-globalread' => 5 , 'librenms-lowpriv' => 1 ];","title":"Authentication Options"},{"location":"Extensions/Authentication/#authentication-modules","text":"LibreNMS supports multiple authentication modules along with Two Factor Auth .

Discovery Methods Below are the methods for auto discovering devices. Each one can be enabled or disabled and may have additional configuration options. ARP Disabled by default. Adds devices that are listed in another device's arp table. This module depends on the arp-table module being enabled and returning data. To enable, switch on globally the $config['discovery_modules']['discovery-arp'] = true; or per device within the Modules section. XDP Enabled by default. $config['autodiscovery']['xdp'] = false; to disable. This includes FDP, CDP and LLDP support based on the device type. The LLDP/xDP links with neighbours will always be discovered as soon as the discovery module is enabled. However, LibreNMS will only try to add the new devices discovered with LLDP/xDP if $config['autodiscovery']['xdp'] = true ; Devices may be excluded from xdp discovery by sysName and sysDescr. //Exclude devices by name $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'xdp_exclude' ][ 'sysname_regexp' ][] = '/host1/' ; $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'xdp_exclude' ][ 'sysname_regexp' ][] = '/^dev/' ; //Exclude devices by description $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'xdp_exclude' ][ 'sysdesc_regexp' ][] = '/Vendor X/' ; $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'xdp_exclude' ][ 'sysdesc_regexp' ][] = '/Vendor Y/' ; Devices may be excluded from cdp discovery by platform. //Exclude devices by platform(Cisco only) $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'cdp_exclude' ][ 'platform_regexp' ][] = '/WS-C3750G/' ; These devices are excluded by default: $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'xdp_exclude' ][ 'sysdesc_regexp' ][] = '/-K9W8-/' ; // Cisco Lightweight Access Point $config [ 'autodiscovery' ][ 'cdp_exclude' ][ 'platform_regexp' ][] = '/^Cisco IP Phone/' ; //Cisco IP Phone OSPF Enabled by default. $config['autodiscovery']['ospf'] = false; to disable. BGP Enabled by default. $config['autodiscovery']['bgp'] = false; to disable. This module is invoked from bgp-peers discovery module. SNMP Scan Apart from the aforementioned Auto-Discovery options, LibreNMS is also able to proactively scan a network for SNMP-enabled devices using the configured version/credentials. SNMP Scan will scan $config['nets'] by default and respects $config['autodiscovery']['nets-exclude'] . To run the SNMP-Scanner you need to execute the snmp-scan.py from within your LibreNMS installation directory. Here the script's help-page for reference: usage: snmp-scan.py [-h] [-r NETWORK] [-t THREADS] [-l] [-v] Scan network for snmp hosts and add them to LibreNMS. optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -r NETWORK CIDR noted IP-Range to scan.

The Driver behind this extension was to provide the features of ports, in a generic manner to discovery/poller modules. It provides a status (Nagios convention), the ability to Disable (do not poll), or Ignore (do not Alert). Database Structure The database structure contains the component table: mysql > select * from component limit 1 ; + ----+-----------+------+------------+--------+----------+--------+-------+ | id | device_id | type | label | status | disabled | ignore | error | + ----+-----------+------+------------+--------+----------+--------+-------+ | 9 | 1 | TEST | TEST LABEL | 0 | 1 | 1 | | + ----+-----------+------+------------+--------+----------+--------+-------+ 1 row in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) These fields are described below: id - ID for each component, unique index device_id - device_id from the devices table type - name from the component_type table label - Display label for the component status - The status of the component, retrieved from the device disabled - Should this component be polled? ignore - Should this component be alerted on error - Error message if in Alert state The component_prefs table holds custom data in an Attribute/Value format: mysql > select * from component_prefs limit 1 ; + ----+-----------+-----------+-----------+ | id | component | attribute | value | + ----+-----------+-----------+-----------+ | 4 | 9 | TEST_ATTR | TEST_ATTR | + ----+-----------+-----------+-----------+ 2 rows in set ( 0 . 00 sec ) Reserved Fields When this data from both the component and component_prefs tables is returned in one single consolidated array, there is the potential for someone to attempt to set an attribute (in the component_prefs ) table that is used in the component table. Because of this all fields of the component table are reserved, they cannot be used as custom attributes, if you update these the module will attempt to write them to the component table, not the component_prefs table. Using Components Create an instance of the component class: $COMPONENT = new LibreNMS\\Component (); Retrieving Components Now you can retrieve an array of the available components: $ARRAY = $COMPONENT -> getComponents ( $DEVICE_ID , $OPTIONS ); getComponents takes 2 arguments: DEVICE_ID or null for all devices. OPTIONS - an array of various options. getComponents will return an array containing components in the following format: Array ( [ X ] => Array ( [ Y1 ] => Array ( [ device_id ] => 1 [ TEST_ATTR ] => TEST_ATTR [ type ] => TEST [ label ] => TEST LABEL [ status ] => 0 [ ignore ] => 1 [ disabled ] => 1 [ error ] => ), [ Y2 ] => Array ( [ device_id ] => 1 [ TEST_ATTR ] => TEST_ATTR [ type ] => TESTING [ label ] => TEST LABEL [ status ] => 0 [ ignore ] => 1 [ disabled ] => 0 [ error ] => ), ) ) Where X is the Device ID and Y1/Y2 is the Component ID. In the example above, TEST_ATTR is a custom field, the rest are reserved fields. Options Options can be supplied to getComponents to influence which and how components are returned. Filtering You can filter on any of the reserved fields. Filters are created in the following format: $options [ 'filter' ][ 'FIELD' ] = array ( 'OPERATOR' , 'CRITERIA' ); Where: FIELD - The reserved field to filter on OPERATOR - 'LIKE' or '=', are we checking if the FIELD equals or contains the CRITERIA. CRITERIA - The criteria to search on There are 2 filtering shortcuts: $DEVICE_ID is a synonym for: $OPTIONS [ 'filter' ][ 'device_id' ] = array ( '=' , $DEVICE_ID ); $OPTIONS['type'] = $TYPE is a synonym for: $OPTIONS [ 'filter' ][ 'type' ] = array ( '=' , $TYPE ); Sorting You can sort the records that are returned by specifying the following option: $OPTIONS [ 'sort' ][ FIELD ] = 'DIRECTION' ; Where Direction is one of: ASC - Ascending, from Low to High DESC - Descending, from High to Low Creating Components To create a new component, run the createComponent function. $ARRAY = $COMPONENT -> createComponent ( $DEVICE_ID , $TYPE ); createComponent takes 2 arguments: DEVICE_ID - The ID of the device to attach the component to. TYPE - The unique type for your module. This will return a new, empty array with a component ID and Type set, all other fields will be set to defaults. Array ( [ 1 ] => Array ( [ type ] => TESTING [ label ] => [ status ] => 1 [ ignore ] => 0 [ disabled ] => 0 [ error ] => ) ) Deleting Components When a component is no longer needed, it can be deleted. $COMPONENT -> deleteComponent ( $COMPONENT_ID ) This will return True on success or False on failure. Editing Components To edit a component, the procedure is: Get the Current Components Edit the array Write the components Edit the Array Once you have a component array from getComponents the first thing to do is extract the components for only the single device you are editing. This is required because the setComponentPrefs function only saves a single device at a time. $ARRAY = $COMPONENT -> getComponents ( $DEVICE_ID , $OPTIONS ); $ARRAY = $ARRAY [ $DEVICE_ID ]; Then simply edit this array to suit your needs. If you need to add a new Attribute/Value pair you can: $ARRAY [ COMPONENT_ID ][ 'New Attribute' ] = \"Value\" ; If you need to delete a previously set Attribute/Value pair you can: unset ( $ARRAY [ COMPONENT_ID ][ 'New Attribute' ]); If you need to edit a previously set Attribute/Value pair you can: $ARRAY [ COMPONENT_ID ][ 'Existing Attribute' ] = \"New Value\" ; Write the components To write component changes back to the database simply: $COMPONENT -> setComponentPrefs ( $DEVICE_ID , $ARRAY ) When writing the component array there are several caveats to be aware of, these are: $ARRAY must be in the format of a single device ID - $ARRAY[$COMPONENT_ID][Attribute] = 'Value'; NOT in the multi device format returned by getComponents - $ARRAY[$DEVICE_ID][$COMPONENT_ID][Attribute] = 'Value'; You cannot edit the Component ID or the Device ID reserved fields can not be removed if a change is found an entry will be written to the eventlog. API Component details are available via the API. Please see the API-Docs for details. Alerting It is intended that discovery/poller modules will detect the status of a component during the polling cycle. Status is logged using the Nagios convention for status codes, where: 0 = Ok, 1 = Warning, 2 = Critical If you are creating a poller module which can detect a fault condition simply set STATUS to something other than 0 and ERROR to a message that indicates the problem. To actually raise an alert, the user will need to create an alert rule. To assist with this several Alerting Macro's have been created: %macro.component_normal - A component that is not disabled or ignored and in a Normal state. %macro.component_warning - A component that is not disabled or ignored and NOT in a Warning state. %macro.component_critical - A component that is not disabled or ignored and NOT in a Critical state. To raise alerts for components, the following rules could be created: %macros.component_critical = \"1\" - To alert on all Critical components %macros.component_critical = \"1\" && %component.type = \"<Type of Component>\" - To alert on all Critical components of a particular type. If there is a particular component you would like excluded from alerting, simply set the ignore field to 1.

You can share dashboards with other users. You can also make a custom dashboard and default it for all users in LibreNMS. Example Dashboard Widgets LibreNMS has a whole list of Widgets to select from. Alerts Widget: Displays all alert notifications. Availability Map: Displays all devices with colored tiles, green up, yellow for warning (device has been restarted in last 24 hours),red for down. You can also list all services and ignored/disabled devcies in this widget. Componet Status: List all componets Ok state, Warning state, Critical state. Device Summary horizontal: List device totals, up, down, ignored, disabled. Same for ports and services. Device Summary vertical: List device totals, up, down, ignored, disabled. Same for ports and services. Eventlog: Displays all events with your devices and LibreNMS. External Image: can be used to show external images on your dashboard. Or images from inside LibreNMS. Globe Map: Will display map of the globe. Graph: Can be used to display graphs from devices. Graylog: Displays all Graylog's syslog entries. Notes: use for html tags, embed links and external web pages. Or just notes in general. Server Stats: Will display gauges for CPU, Memory, Storage usage. Note the device type has to be listed as \"Server\". Syslog: Displays all syslog entries. Top Devices: By Traffic, or Uptime, or Response time, or Poller Duration, or Procssor load, or Memory Usage, or Storage Usage. Top Interfaces: Lists top interfaces by traffic utilization. Worldmap: displays all your devices locations. From syslocation or from override sysLocation. List of Widgets: Dashboard Permissions Private: Sets the dashabord to only the user that created the dashboard can view and edit. Shared Read: Sets the dashboard to allow other users to view the dashboard, but cant make changes to the dashboard. Shared: Allows all users to view the dashboard and make changes. Setting a global default dashboard Step 1: Set the dashboard to either shared read or shared, depending on what you want the users access to change. Step 2: Then go to Settings -> WebUI settings -> Dashboard Settings and set the global default dashboard. Setting embeded webpage Using the Notes Widget. < iframe src = \"your_url\" frameBorder = \"0\" width = \"100%\" height = \"100%\" > < p > Your browser does not support iframes. </ p > </ iframe > Note you may need to play with the width and height and also size your widget properly. src=\"url\" needs to be URL to webpage your linking to.

Distributed polling is not intended for remote polling. Devices can be grouped together into a poller_group to pin these devices to a single or a group of designated pollers. All pollers need to write to the same set of RRD files, preferably via RRDcached. It is a requirement that all pollers can access the central memcached to communicate with each other. Requirements These requirements are above the normal requirements for a full LibreNMS install. rrdtool version 1.4 or above Python 3 python-memcached package a memcached install a rrdcached install By default, all hosts are shared and have the poller_group = 0 . To pin a device to a poller, set it to a value greater than 0 and set the same value in the poller's config with $config['distributed_poller_group'] . One can also specify a comma separated string of poller groups in $config['distributed_poller_group']. The poller will then poll devices from any of the groups listed. If new devices get added from the poller they will be assigned to the first poller group in the list unless the group is specified when adding the device. A standard configuration for a distributed poller would look like: // Distributed Poller-Settings $config [ 'distributed_poller' ] = true ; // optional: defaults to hostname #$config['distributed_poller_name'] = 'custom'; $config [ 'distributed_poller_group' ] = 0 ; $config [ 'distributed_poller_memcached_host' ] = 'example.net' ; $config [ 'distributed_poller_memcached_port' ] = '11211' ; Example Setup Below is an example setup based on a real deployment which at the time of writing covers over 2,500 devices and 50,000 ports. The setup is running within an OpenStack environment with some commodity hardware for remote pollers. Here's a diagram of how you can scale LibreNMS out: Architecture How you setup the distribution is entirely up to you, you can choose to host the majority of the required services on a single virtual machine or server and then a poller to actually query the devices being monitored all the way through to having a dedicated server for each of the individual roles. Below are notes on what you need to consider both from the software layer but also connectivity. Web / API Layer This is typically Apache but we have setup guides for both Nginx and Lighttpd which should work perfectly fine. There is nothing unique about the role this service is providing except that if you are adding devices from this layer then the web service will need to be able to connect to the end device via SNMP and perform an ICMP test. It is advisable to run RRDCached within this setup so that you don't need to share the rrd folder via a remote file share such as NFS. The web service can then generate rrd graphs via RRDCached. If RRDCached isn't an option then you can mount the rrd directory to read the RRD files directly. Database Server MySQL / MariaDB - At the moment these are the only database servers that are supported. The pollers, web and API layers should all be able to access the database server directly. RRD Storage Central storage should be provided so all RRD files can be read from and written to in one location. As suggested above, it's recommended that RRD Cached is configured and used. For this example, we are running RRDCached to allow all pollers and web/api servers to read/write to the rrd files with the rrd directory also exported by NFS for simple access and maintenance. Memcache Memcache is required for the distributed pollers to be able to register to a central location and record what devices are polled. Memcache can run from any of the servers so long as it is accessible by all pollers. Pollers Pollers can be installed and run from anywhere, the only requirements are: They can access the Memcache instance They can create RRD files via some method such as a shared filesystem or RRDTool >=1.5.5 They can access the MySQL server You can either assign pollers into groups and set a poller group against certain devices, this will mean that those devices will only be processed by certain pollers (default poller group is 0) or you can assign all pollers to the default poller group for them to process any and all devices. This will provide the ability to have a single poller behind a NAT firewall monitor internal devices and report back to your central system. You will then be able to monitor those devices from the Web UI as normal. Another benefit to this is that you can provide N+x pollers, i.e if you know that you require three pollers to process all devices within 300 seconds then adding a 4th poller will mean that should any one single poller fail then the remaining three will complete polling in time. You could also use this to take a poller out of service for maintenance, i.e OS updates and software updates. It is extremely advisable to either run a central recursive dns server such as pdns-recursor and have all of your pollers use this or install a recursive dns server on each poller - the volume of DNS requests on large installs can be significant and will slow polling down enough to cause issues with a large number of devices. A last note to make sure of, is that all pollers writing to the same DB need to have the same APP_KEY value set in the .env file. Discovery It's not necessary to run discovery services on all pollers. In fact, you should only run one discovery process per poller group. Designate a single poller to run discovery (or a separate server if required). Configuration Settings in config.php should be copied to all servers as they only apply locally.

There is nothing unique about the role this service is providing except that if you are adding devices from this layer then the web service will need to be able to connect to the end device via SNMP and perform an ICMP test. It is advisable to run RRDCached within this setup so that you don't need to share the rrd folder via a remote file share such as NFS. The web service can then generate rrd graphs via RRDCached.

This will provide the ability to have a single poller behind a NAT firewall monitor internal devices and report back to your central system. You will then be able to monitor those devices from the Web UI as normal. Another benefit to this is that you can provide N+x pollers, i.e if you know that you require three pollers to process all devices within 300 seconds then adding a 4th poller will mean that should any one single poller fail then the remaining three will complete polling in time. You could also use this to take a poller out of service for maintenance, i.e OS updates and software updates. It is extremely advisable to either run a central recursive dns server such as pdns-recursor and have all of your pollers use this or install a recursive dns server on each poller - the volume of DNS requests on large installs can be significant and will slow polling down enough to cause issues with a large number of devices.

This can also be an array to specify more directories like: $config [ 'nfsen_rrds' ][] = '/var/nfsen/profiles-stat/sitea/' ; $config [ 'nfsen_rrds' ][] = '/var/nfsen/profiles-stat/siteb/' ; Although for most setups, it will look like below, with the profiles-stat/live directory being where it stores the general RRDs for data sources. $config [ 'nfsen_rrds' ][] = '/var/nfsen/profiles-stat/live' ; If you wish to render info for configure channels for a device, you need add the various profile-stat directories your system uses, which for most systems will be as below. $config [ 'nfsen_rrds' ][] = '/var/nfsen/profiles-stat' ; When adding sources to nfsen.conf, it is important to use the hostname that matches what is configured in LibreNMS, because the rrd files NfSen creates is named after the source name (ident), and it doesn't allow you to use an IP address instead. However, in LibreNMS, if your device is added by an IP address, add your source with any name of your choice, and create a symbolic link to the rrd file. cd /var/nfsen/profiles-stat/sitea/ ln -s mychannel.rrd librenmsdeviceIP.rrd $config [ 'nfsen_split_char' ] = '_' ; This value tells us what to replace the full stops . in the devices hostname with. $config [ 'nfsen_suffix' ] = \"_yourdomain_com\" ; The above is a very important bit as device names in NfSen are limited to 21 characters. This means full domain names for devices can be very problematic to squeeze in, so therefor this chunk is usually removed.

Pre installed plugins Note: Plugins will only load if they are prefixed with \"check_\" and they have that prefix stripped out when displaying in the \"Add Service\" GUI \"Type\" dropdown list. Plugins come from two main places pkg-nagios-plugins-contrib and monitoring-plugins . This is where you can find the documentation for most, if not all of the plugins. The plugins are bundled with the pre build VM images via the package monitoring-plugins in Ubuntu and nagios-plugins-all in CentOS. Setup Service checks is now distributed aware. If you run a distributed setup then you can now run services-wrapper.py in cron instead of check-services.php across all polling nodes. If you need to debug the output of services-wrapper.py then you can add -d to the end of the command - it is NOT recommended to do this in cron. Firstly, install Nagios plugins however you would like, this could be via yum, apt-get or direct from source. Next, you need to enable the services within config.php with the following: $config [ 'show_services' ] = 1 ; This will enable a new service menu within your navbar. $config [ 'nagios_plugins' ] = \"/usr/lib/nagios/plugins\" ; This will point LibreNMS at the location of the nagios plugins - please ensure that any plugins you use are set to executable. For example: chmod +x /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/* Finally, you now need to add services-wrapper.py to the current cron file (/etc/cron.d/librenms typically) like: */5 * * * * librenms /opt/librenms/services-wrapper.py 1 Now you can add services via the main Services link in the navbar, or via the 'Add Service' link within the device, services page. Note that some services (procs, inodes, load and similar) will always poll the local LibreNMS server it's running on, regardless of which device you add it to. Performance data By default, the check-services script will collect all performance data that the Nagios script returns and display each datasource on a separate graph. LibreNMS expects scripts to return using Nagios convention for the response message structure: AEN200 However for some modules it would be better if some of this information was consolidated on a single graph. An example is the ICMP check. This check returns: Round Trip Average (rta), Round Trip Min (rtmin) and Round Trip Max (rtmax). These have been combined onto a single graph. If you find a check script that would benefit from having some datasources graphed together, please log an issue on GitHub with the debug information from the script, and let us know which DS's should go together. Example below: ./check-services.php -d -- snip -- Nagios Service - 26 Request: /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_icmp localhost Perf Data - DS: rta, Value: 0.016, UOM: ms Perf Data - DS: pl, Value: 0, UOM: % Perf Data - DS: rtmax, Value: 0.044, UOM: ms Perf Data - DS: rtmin, Value: 0.009, UOM: ms Response: OK - localhost: rta 0.016ms, lost 0% Service DS: { \"rta\": \"ms\", \"pl\": \"%\", \"rtmax\": \"ms\", \"rtmin\": \"ms\" } OK u:0.00 s:0.00 r:40.67 RRD[update /opt/librenms/rrd/localhost/services-26.rrd N:0.016:0:0.044:0.009] -- snip -- Alerting Services uses the Nagios Alerting scheme where: 0 = Ok, 1 = Warning, 2 = Critical, To create an alerting rule to alert on service=critical, your alerting rule would look like: %services.service_status = \"2\" Debug Change user to librenms for example su - librenms then you can run the following command to help troubleshoot services. ./check-services.php -d Service checks polling logic Service check is skipped when the associated device is not pingable, and an appropriate entry is populated in the event log. Service check is polled if it's IP address parameter is not equal to associated device's IP address, even when the associated device is not pingable. To override the default logic and always poll service checks, you can disable ICMP testing for any device by switching Disable ICMP Test setting (Edit -> Misc) to ON. Service checks will never be polled on disabled devices. CHECK_MRPE In most cases, only Nagios plugins that run against a remote host with the -H option are available as services. However, if you're remote host is running the Check_MK agent you may be able to use MRPE to monitor Nagios plugins that only execute locally as services. For example, consider the fairly common check_cpu.sh Nagios plugin. If you added.. cpu_check /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_cpu.sh -c 95 -w 75 ...to /etc/check_mk/mrpe.cfg on your remote host, you should be able to check its output by configuring a service using the check_mrpe script. Add check_mrpe to the Nagios plugins directory on your LibreNMS server and make it executable. In LibreNMS, add a new service to the desired device with the type mrpe. Enter the IP address of the remote host and in parameters enter -a cpu_check (this should match the name used at the beginning of the line in the mrpe.cfg file).","title":"Nagios Plugins"},{"location":"Extensions/Services/#setting-up-services","text":"Services within LibreNMS provides the ability to use Nagios plugins to perform additional monitoring outside of SNMP.

First, install the output-exec plugin for logstash: /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-output-exec Next, create a logstash configuration file (ex. /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash-simple.conf), and add the following: input { syslog { port => 514 } } output { exec { command => \"echo `echo %{host},,,,%{facility},,,,%{priority},,,,%{severity},,,,%{facility_label},,,,``date --date='%{timestamp}' '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'``echo ',,,,%{message}'``echo ,,,,%{program} | sed 's/\\x25\\x7b\\x70\\x72\\x6f\\x67\\x72\\x61\\x6d\\x7d/%{facility_label}/'` | sed 's/,,,,/||/g' | /opt/librenms/syslog.php &\" } elasticsearch { hosts => [\"10.10.10.10:9200\"] index => \"syslog-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}\" } } Replace 10.10.10.10 with your primary elasticsearch server IP, and set the incoming syslog port. Alternatively, if you already have a logstash config file that works except for the LibreNMS export, take only the \"exec\" section from output and add it.

To fix this issue, you can configure LibreNMS to translate the incoming syslog hostname into another hostname, so that the logs get associated with the correct device. Example: $config['syslog_xlate'] = array( 'loopback0.core7k1.noc.net' => 'n7k1-core7k1', 'loopback0.core7k2.noc.net' => 'n7k2-core7k2' );","title":"Syslog"},{"location":"Extensions/Syslog/#setting-up-syslog-support","text":"This document will explain how to send syslog data to LibreNMS.

Let's start off by saying, all of the code that processes the data and submits it is included in the standard LibreNMS branch you've installed, the code that accepts this data and in turn generates some pretty graphs is all open source and available on Git Hub. Please feel free to review the code, comment on it and suggest changes / improvements. Also, don't forget - by default installations DO NOT call back home, you need to opt into this. Above all we respect users privacy which is why this system has been designed like it has. Now onto the bit you're interested in, what is submitted and what we do with that data. What is submitted All data is anonymous. Generic statistics are taken from the database, these include things like device count, device type, device OS, port types, port speeds, port count and BGP peer count. Take a look at the code for full details. Pairs of sysDescr and sysObjectID from devices with a small amount of sanitation to prevent things like hostnames from being submitted. We record version numbers of php, mysql, net-snmp and rrdtool A random UUID is generated on your own install. That's it! Your IP isn't logged, even via our web service accepting the data. We don't need to know who you are so we don't ask. What we do with the data We store it, not for long - 3 months at the moment although this could change. We use it to generate pretty graphs for people to see. We use it to help prioritise issues and features that need to be worked on. We use sysDescr and sysObjectID to create unit tests and improve OS discovery Questions? Q. How often is data submitted? A. We submit the data once a day according to running daily.sh via cron. If you disable this then opting in will not have any affect. Q. Where can I see the data I submitted? A. You can't see the data raw, but we collate all of the data together and provide a dynamic site so you can see the results of all contributed stats here Q. I want my data removed. A. That's easy, simply press 'Clear remote stats' in the About LibreNMS page of your control panel, the next time the call back script is run it will remove all the data we have. Q. I clicked the 'Clear remote stats' button by accident. A. No problem, before daily.sh runs again - just opt back in, all of your existing data will stay. Hopefully this answers the questions you might have on why and what we are doing here, if not, please pop into our discord server or community forum and ask any questions you like. How do I enable stats submission? If you're happy with all of this - please consider switching the call back system on, you can do this within the About LibreNMS page within your control panel.

Development branch Our master branch is our dev branch, this is actively commited to and it's not uncommon for multiple commits to be merged in daily. As such sometimes changes will be introduced which will cause unintended issues. If this happens we are usually quick to fix or revert those changes.

The reason for the fork has nothing to do with Observium's move to community vs. paid versions . It is simply that we have different priorities and values to the Observium development team. We decided to fork (reluctantly) because we like using Observium, but we want to collaborate on a community-based project with like-minded IT professionals. See README.md and the references there for more information about the kind of community we're trying to promote. LibreNMS was forked from the last GPL-licensed version of Observium . Thanks to one of our users, Dan Brown, who has written a migration script , you can easily move your Observium install over to LibreNMS. This also takes care of moving from one CPU architecture to another. Give it a try :) How LibreNMS will be different from Observium: We will have an inclusive community, where it's OK to ask stupid questions, and OK to ask for things that aren't on the roadmap. If you'd like to see something added, add or comment on the relevant issue in our Community forum . Development decisions will be community-driven. We want to make software that fulfills its users' needs. There are no plans for a paid version, and we don't anticipate this ever changing. There are no current plans for paid support, but this may be added later if there is sufficient demand. We use git for version control and GitHub for hosting to make it as easy and painless as possible to create forked or private versions. Reasons why you might want to use Observium instead of LibreNMS: You have a financial investment in Observium and aren't concerned about community contributions. You don't like the GNU General Public License, version 3 or the philosophy of Free Software/copyleft in general. Reasons why you might want to use LibreNMS instead of Observium: You want to work with others on the project, knowing that your investment of time and effort will not be wasted . You want to add and experiment with features that are not a priority for the Observium developers. See CONTRIBUTING for more details. You want to make use of the additional features LibreNMS can offer.","title":"Welcome to Observium users"},{"location":"General/Changelogs/2013/","text":"Nov 2013 Bug fixes Updates to fix arp

In either case, you need to ensure the appropriate port (443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH) is open in the outbound direction for your server. cd /opt git clone https://github.com/librenms/librenms.git librenms cd /opt/librenms NOTE: The recommended method of cloning a git repository is HTTPS. If you would like to clone via SSH instead, use the command git clone git@github.com:librenms/librenms.git librenms instead. Prepare the Web Interface To prepare the web interface, you'll need to create and chown a directory as well as create an Apache vhost. First, create and chown the rrd directory and create the logs directory mkdir rrd logs chown -R librenms:librenms /opt/librenms chmod 775 rrd If you're planing on running rrdcached, make sure that the path is also chmod'ed to 775 and chown'ed to librenms:librenms. SELinux if you're using SELinux you need to allow web server user to write into logs directory. semanage tool is a part of policycoreutils-python, so if don't have it, you can install it Please note that running LibreNMS with SELinux is still experimental and we cannot guarantee that everything will be working fine for now. yum install policycoreutils-python semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/opt/librenms/logs(/.*)?' semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t '/opt/librenms/logs(/.*)?' restorecon -RFvv /opt/librenms/logs/ Set selinux to allow httpd to sendmail setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail = 1 Start the web-server # For HTTPd (Apache): service httpd restart # For Nginx: service nginx restart Web Installer At this stage you can launch the web installer by going to http://IP/install.php and follow the on-screen instructions. Alternatively if you want to continue the setup manually then perform the manual install steps. If you cannot reach the installer, stop here and solve that problem before proceeding. Afterwards, Add the following line to the end of config.php : $config['fping'] = \"/usr/sbin/fping\"; Manual Install You may skip this section if the web installer succeeded. cp config.php.default config.php vi config.php Change the values to the right of the equal sign for lines beginning with $config[db_] to match your database information as previously configured. Change the value of $config['snmp']['community'] from public to whatever your default read-only SNMP community is. If you have multiple existing communities in your environment, set it to the most common. Add the following line to the end of config.php : $config['fping'] = \"/usr/sbin/fping\"; Important: Be sure you have no characters (including whitespace like: newlines, spaces, tabs, etc) outside of the <?php?> blocks. Your graphs will break otherwise and there will be no error messages to indicate otherwise! Initialize the database Initiate the follow database with the following command: php build-base.php Create admin user Create the admin user - priv should be 10 php adduser.php <name> <pass> 10 <email> Substitute your desired username, password and email address--and leave the angled brackets off. Validate your install After performing the manual install or web install, be sure to run validate.php as root in the librenms directory: php validate.php This will check your install to verify it is set up correctly. Add localhost php addhost.php localhost public v2c Replace public to match what you set in /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf . This command also assumes you are using SNMP v2c. If you're using v3, there are additional steps (NOTE: instructions for SNMPv3 to come). Discover localhost: php discovery.php -h all Create cronjob The polling method used by LibreNMS is poller-wrapper.py , which was placed in the public domain by its author. By default, the LibreNMS cronjob runs poller-wrapper.py with 16 threads. The current LibreNMS recommendation is to use 4 threads per core. The default if no thread count is 16 threads . If the thread count needs to be changed, you can do so by editing the cron file ( /etc/cron.d/librenms ). Just add a number after poller-wrapper.py , as in the below example: /opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 12 >> /dev/null 2>&1 Create the cronjob cp librenms.nonroot.cron /etc/cron.d/librenms NOTE: Keep in mind that cron, by default, only uses a very limited set of environment variables. You may need to configure proxy variables for the cron invocation. Alternatively adding the proxy settings in config.php is possible too. The config.php file will be created in the upcoming steps. Review the following URL after you finished librenms install steps: https://docs.librenms.org/Support/Configuration/#proxy-support Copy logrotate config LibreNMS keeps logs in /opt/librenms/logs . Over time these can become large and be rotated out. To rotate out the old logs you can use the provided logrotate config file: cp misc/librenms.logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/librenms Daily Updates LibreNMS performs daily updates by default. At 00:15 system time every day, a git pull --no-edit --quiet is performed. You can override this default by editing your config.php file. Remove the comment (the # mark) on the line: #$config['update'] = 0; so that it looks like this: $config['update'] = 0; Install complete Please allow for 2-3 runs of the poller-wrapper for data to start appearing in the WebUI. If you don't see data after this, please refer to the FAQ for assistance. That's it! You now should be able to log in to http://librenms.example.com/ . Please note that we have not covered HTTPS setup in this example, so your LibreNMS install is not secure by default. Please do not expose it to the public Internet unless you have configured HTTPS and taken appropriate web server hardening steps.

NOTE: Setting a higher timeout value than the interval value can lead to slowing down poller. Example: timeout: 3000 count: 3 interval: 500 In this example, interval will be overwritten by the timeout value of 3000 which is 3 seconds.

Exact Matching: $config [ 'location_map' ][ 'Under the Sink' ] = \"Under The Sink, The Office, London, UK\" ; Regex Matching: $config [ 'location_map_regex' ][ '/Sink/' ] = \"Under The Sink, The Office, London, UK\" ; Regex Match Substitution: $config [ 'location_map_regex_sub' ][ '/Sink/' ] = \"Under The Sink, The Office, London, UK [lat, long]\" ; If you have an SNMP SysLocation of \"Rack10,Rm-314,Sink\", Regex Match Substition yields \"Rack10,Rm-314,Under The Sink, The Office, London, UK [lat, long]\". This allows you to keep the SysLocation string short and keeps Rack/Room/Building information intact after the substitution. The above are examples, these will rewrite device snmp locations so you don't need to configure full location within snmp. Interfaces to be ignored Interfaces can be automatically ignored during discovery by modifying bad_if* entries in a default array, unsetting a default array and customizing it, or creating an OS specific array. The preferred method for ignoring interfaces is to use an OS specific array. The default arrays can be found in misc/config_definitions.json. OS specific definitions (includes/definitions/ specific_os .yaml) can contain bad_if* arrays, but should only be modified via pull-request as manipulation of the definition files will block updating. Examples: Add entries to default arrays $config [ 'bad_if' ][] = \"voip-null\" ; $config [ 'bad_iftype' ][] = \"voiceEncap\" ; $config [ 'bad_if_regexp' ][] = '/^lo[0-9].*/' ; // loopback Unset and customize a default array unset ( $config [ 'bad_if' ]); $config [ 'bad_if' ][] = \"voip-null\" ; $config [ 'bad_if' ][] = \"voiceEncap\" ; $config [ 'bad_if' ][] = \"voiceFXO\" ; ... Create an OS specific array $config [ 'os' ][ 'iosxe' ][ 'bad_iftype' ][] = \"macSecControlledIF\" ; $config [ 'os' ][ 'iosxe' ][ 'bad_iftype' ][] = \"macSecUncontrolledIF\" ; Various bad_if* selection options available bad_if is matched against the ifDescr value. bad_iftype is matched against the ifType value. bad_if_regexp is matched against the ifDescr value as a regular expression. bad_ifname_regexp is matched against the ifName value as a regular expression. bad_ifalias_regexp is matched against the ifAlias value as a regular expression. Interfaces that shouldn't be ignored Examples: $config [ 'good_if' ][] = 'FastEthernet' ; $config [ 'os' ][ 'ios' ][ 'good_if' ][] = 'FastEthernet' ; good_if is matched against ifDescr value. This can be a bad_if value as well which would stop that port from being ignored. I.e If bad_if and good_if both contained FastEthernet then ports with this value in the ifDescr will be valid. Interfaces to be rewritten $config [ 'rewrite_if' ][ 'cpu' ] = 'Management Interface' ; $config [ 'rewrite_if_regexp' ][ '/cpu /' ] = 'Management ' ; Entries defined in rewrite_if are being replaced completely. Entries defined in rewrite_if_regexp only replace the match. Matches are compared case-insensitive. Entity sensors to be ignored Some devices register bogus sensors as they are returned via SNMP but either don't exist or just don't return data. This allows you to ignore those based on the descr field in the database. You can either ignore globally or on a per os basis. $config [ 'bad_entity_sensor_regex' ][] = '/Physical id [0-9]+/' ; $config [ 'os' ][ 'cisco' ][ 'bad_entity_sensor_regex' ] = '/Physical id [0-9]+/' ; Entity sensors limit values Vendors may give some limit values (or thresholds) for the discovered sensors.

What information do you need to add a new OS? What can I do to help? How can I test another users branch? How do I install LibreNMS? This is currently well documented within the doc folder of the installation files. Please see the following doc How do I add a device? You have two options for adding a new device into LibreNMS. 1: Using the command line via ssh you can add a new device by changing to the directory of your LibreNMS install and typing (be sure to put the correct details). ./addhost.php [community] [v1|v2c] [port] [udp|udp6|tcp|tcp6] Please note that if the community contains special characters such as $ then you will need to wrap it in ' . I.e: 'Pa$$w0rd' . 2: Using the web interface, go to Devices and then Add Device. Enter the details required for the device that you want to add and then click 'Add Host'. How do I get help? Getting Help What are the supported OSes for installing LibreNMS on? Supported is quite a strong word :) The 'officially' supported distros are: Ubuntu / Debian Red Hat / CentOS Gentoo However we will always aim to help wherever possible so if you are running a distro that isn't one of the above then give it a try anyway and if you need help then jump on the discord server . Do you have a demo available? We do indeed, you can find access to the demo here How does LibreNMS use MIBs? LibreNMS does not parse MIBs to discover sensors for devices. LibreNMS uses static discovery definitions written in YAML or PHP. Therefore, updating a MIB alone will not improve OS support, the definitions must be updated. LibreNMS only uses MIBs to make OIDs easier to read. Why do I get blank pages sometimes in the WebUI? You can enable debug information by setting APP_DEBUG=true in your .env. (Do not leave this enabled, it could leak private data) If the page you are trying to load has a substantial amount of data in it then it could be that the php memory limit needs to be increased in config.php . Why do I not see any graphs? The easiest way to check if all is well is to run ./validate.php as root from within your install directory. This should give you info on why things aren't working. One other reason could be a restricted snmpd.conf file or snmp view which limits the data sent back. If you use net-snmp then we suggest using the included snmpd.conf file. How do I debug pages not loading correctly? A debug system is in place which enables you to see the output from php errors, warnings and notices along with the MySQL queries that have been run for that page. You can enable debug information by setting APP_DEBUG=true in your .env. (Do not leave this enabled, it could leak private data) To see additional information, run ./scripts/composer_wrapper.php install , to install additional debug tools. This will add a debug bar at the bottom of every page that will show you detailed debug information. How do I debug the discovery process? Please see the Discovery Support document for further details. How do I debug the poller process? Please see the Poller Support document for further details. Why do I get a lot apache or rrdtool zombies in my process list? If this is related to your web service for LibreNMS then this has been tracked down to an issue within php which the developers aren't fixing. We have implemented a work around which means you shouldn't be seeing this. If you are, please report this in issue 443 . Why do I see traffic spikes in my graphs? This occurs either when a counter resets or the device sends back bogus data making it look like a counter reset. We have enabled support for setting a maximum value for rrd files for ports. Before this all rrd files were set to 100G max values, now you can enable support to limit this to the actual port speed. rrdtool tune will change the max value when the interface speed is detected as being changed (min value will be set for anything 10M or over) or when you run the included script (./scripts/tune_port.php) - see RRDTune doc SNMP ifInOctets and ifOutOctets are counters, which means they start at 0 (at device boot) and count up from there. LibreNMS records the value every 5 minutes and uses the difference between the previous value and the current value to calculate rate. (Also, this value resets to 0 when it hits the max value) Now, when the value is not recorded for awhile RRD (our time series storage) does not record a 0, it records the last value, otherwise, there would be even worse problems. Then finally we get the current ifIn/OutOctets value and record that. Now, it appears as though all of the traffic since it stopped getting values have occurred in the last 5 minute interval. So whenever you see spikes like this, it means we have not received data from the device for several polling intervals. The cause can vary quite a bit: bad snmp implementations, intermittant network connectivity, broken poller, and more. Why do I see gaps in my graphs? This is most commonly due to the poller not being able to complete it's run within 300 seconds. Check which devices are causing this by going to /poll-log/ within the Web interface. When you find the device(s) which are taking the longest you can then look at the Polling module graph under Graphs -> Poller -> Poller Modules Performance. Take a look at what modules are taking the longest and disabled un used modules. If you poll a large number of devices / ports then it's recommended to run a local recurisve dns server such as pdns-recursor. Running RRDCached is also highly advised in larger installs but has benefits no matter the size. How do I change the IP / hostname of a device? There is a host rename tool called renamehost.php in your librenms root directory. When renaming you are also changing the device's IP / hostname address for monitoring. Usage: ./renamehost.php <old hostname> <new hostname> You can also rename a device in the Web UI by going to the device, then clicking settings Icon -> Edit. My device doesn't finish polling within 300 seconds We have a few things you can try: Disable unnecessary polling modules under edit device. Set a max repeater value within the snmp settings for a device. What to set this to is tricky, you really should run an snmpbulkwalk with -Cr10 through -Cr50 to see what works best. 50 is usually a good choice if the device can cope. Things aren't working correctly? Run ./validate.php as root from within your install. Re-run ./validate.php once you've resolved any issues raised. You have an odd issue - we'd suggest you join our discord server to discuss. What do the values mean in my graphs? The values you see are reported as metric values. Thanks to a post on Reddit here are those values: 10^-18 a - atto 10^-15 f - femto 10^-12 p - pico 10^-9 n - nano 10^-6 u - micro 10^-3 m - milli 0 (no unit) 10^3 k - kilo 10^6 M - mega 10^9 G - giga 10^12 T - tera 10^15 P - peta Why does a device show as a warning? This is indicating that the device has rebooted within the last 24 hours (by default). If you want to adjust this threshold then you can do so by setting $config['uptime_warning'] = '84600'; in config.php . The value must be in seconds. Why do I not see all interfaces in the Overall traffic graph for a device? By default numerous interface types and interface descriptions are excluded from this graph. The excluded defailts are: $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/loopback/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/tunnel/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/virtual/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/mpls/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/ieee8023adLag/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/l2vlan/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/ppp/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/loopback/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/vlan/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/tunnel/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/bond/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/null/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_descr' ][] = '/dummy/' ; If you would like to re-include l2vlan interfaces for instance, you first need to unset the config array and set your options: unset ( $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ]); $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/loopback/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/tunnel/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/virtual/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/mpls/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/ieee8023adLag/' ; $config [ 'device_traffic_iftype' ][] = '/ppp/' ; How do I move my LibreNMS install to another server? If you are moving from one CPU architecture to another then you will need to dump the rrd files and re-create them. If you are in this scenario then you can use Dan Brown's migration scripts . If you are just moving to another server with the same CPU architecture then the following steps should be all that's needed: Install LibreNMS as per our normal documentation; you don't need to run through the web installer or building the sql schema. Stop cron by commenting out all lines in /etc/cron.d/librenms Dump the MySQL database librenms from your old server ( mysqldump librenms -u root -p > librenms.sql )... and import it into your new server ( mysql -u root -p librenms < librenms.sql ). Copy the rrd/ folder to the new server. Copy the .env and config.php files to the new server. Check for modified files (eg specific os, ...) with git status and migrate them. Ensure ownership of the copied files and folders (substitute your user if necessary) - chown -R librenms:librenms /opt/librenms Delete old pollers on the GUI (gear icon --> Pollers --> Pollers) Validate your installation (/opt/librenms/validate.php) Re-enable cron by uncommenting all lines in /etc/cron.d/librenms Why is my EdgeRouter device not detected? If you have service snmp description set in your config then this will be why, please remove this. For some reason Ubnt have decided setting this value should override the sysDescr value returned which breaks our detection. If you don't have that set then this may be then due to an update of EdgeOS or a new device type, please create an issue . Why are some of my disks not showing? If you are monitoring a linux server then net-snmp doesn't always expose all disks via hrStorage (HOST-RESOURCES-MIB). We have additional support which will retrieve disks via dskTable (UCD-SNMP-MIB). To expose these disks you need to add additional config to your snmpd.conf file. For example, to expose /dev/sda1 which may be mounted as /storage you can specify: disk /dev/sda1 Or disk /storage Restart snmpd and LibreNMS should populate the additional disk after a fresh discovery. Why are my disks reporting an incorrect size? There is a known issue for net-snmp, which causes it to report incorrect disk size and disk usage when the size of the disk (or raid) are larger then 16TB, a workaround has been implemented but is not active on Centos 6.8 by default due to the fact that this workaround breaks official SNMP specs, and as such could cause unexpected behaviour in other SNMP tools. You can activate the workaround by adding to /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf : realStorageUnits 0 What does mean \\\"ignore alert tag\\\" on device, component, service and port? Tag device, component, service and port to ignore alerts. Alert checks will still run. However, ignore tag can be read in alert rules. For example on device, if devices.ignore = 0 or macros.device = 1 condition is is set and ignore alert tag is on, the alert rule won't match. The alert rule is ignored. How do I add support for a new OS? Please see Supporting a new OS if you are adding all the support yourself, i.e. writing all of the supporting code. If you are only able to supply supporting info, and would like the help of others to write up the code, please follow the below steps. What information do you need to add a new OS? Please open a feature request in the community forum and provide the output of Discovery, Poller, and Snmpwalk as separate non-expiring https://p.libren.ms/ links : Please use preferably the command line to obtain the information. Especially, if snmpwalk results in a large amount of data. Replace the relevant information in these commands such as HOSTNAME and COMMUNITY. Use snmpwalk instead of snmpbulkwalk for v1 devices. These commands will automatically upload the data to LibreNMS servers. ./discovery.php -h HOSTNAME -d | ./pbin.sh ./poller.php -h HOSTNAME -r -f -d | ./pbin.sh snmpbulkwalk -OUneb -v2c -c COMMUNITY HOSTNAME . | ./pbin.sh You can use the links provided by these commands within the community post. If possible please also provide what the OS name should be if it doesn't exist already, as well as any useful link (MIBs from vendor, logo, etc etc) What can I do to help? Thanks for asking, sometimes it's not quite so obvious and everyone can contribute something different. So here are some ways you can help LibreNMS improve. Code. This is a big thing. We want this community to grow by the software developing and evolving to cater for users needs. The biggest area that people can help make this happen is by providing code support. This doesn't necessarily mean contributing code for discovering a new device: Web UI, a new look and feel has been adopted but we are not finished by any stretch of the imagination. Make suggestions, find and fix bugs, update the design / layout. Poller / Discovery code. Improving it (we think a lot can be done to speed things up), adding new device support and updating old ones. The LibreNMS main website, this is hosted on GitHub like the main repo and we accept use contributions here as well :) Hardware. We don't physically need it but if we are to add device support, it's made a whole lot easier with access to the kit via SNMP. If you've got MIBs, they are handy as well :) If you know the vendor and can get permission to use logos that's also great. Bugs. Found one? We want to know about it. Most bugs are fixed after being spotted and reported by someone, I'd love to say we are amazing developers and will fix all bugs before you spot them but that's just not true. Feature requests. Can't code / won't code. No worries, chuck a feature request into our community forum with enough detail and someone will take a look. A lot of the time this might be what interests someone, they need the same feature or they just have time. Please be patient, everyone who contributes does so in their own time. Documentation. Documentation can always be improved and every little bit helps. Not all features are currently documented or documented well, there's speeling mistakes etc. It's very easy to submit updates through the GitHub website , no git experience needed. Be nice, this is the foundation of this project. We expect everyone to be nice. People will fall out, people will disagree but please do it so in a respectable way. Ask questions. Sometimes just by asking questions you prompt deeper conversations that can lead us to somewhere amazing so please never be afraid to ask a question. How can I test another users branch? LibreNMS can and is developed by anyone, this means someone may be working on a new feature or support for a device that you want. It can be helpful for others to test these new features, using Git, this is made easy. cd /opt/librenms Firstly ensure that your current branch is in good state: git status If you see nothing to commit, working directory clean then let's go for it :) Let's say that you want to test a users (f0o) new development branch (issue-1337) then you can do the following: git remote add f0o https://github.com/f0o/librenms.git git remote update f0o git checkout issue-1337 Once you are done testing, you can easily switch back to the master branch: git checkout master If you want to pull any new updates provided by f0o's branch then whilst you are still in it, do the following: git pull f0o issue-1337 Why can't Normal and Global View users see Oxidized? Configs can often contain sensitive data. Because of that only global admins can see configs. What is the Demo User for? Demo users allow full access except adding/editing users and deleting devices and can't change passwords. Why does modifying 'Default Alert Template' fail? This template's entry could be missing in the database. Please run this from the LibreNMS directory: php artisan db:seed --class = DefaultAlertTemplateSeeder Why would alert un-mute itself? If alert un-mutes itself then it most likely means that the alert cleared and is then triggered again. Please review eventlog as it will tell you in there. How do I change the Device Type? You can change the Device Type by going to the device you would like to change, then click on the Gear Icon -> Edit. If you would like to define custom types, we suggest using Device Groups . They will be listed in the menu similarly to device types. Where do I update my database credentials? If you've changed your database credentials then you will need to update LibreNMS with those new details. Please edit .env .env : DB_HOST= DB_DATABASE= DB_USERNAME= DB_PASSWORD= DB_PORT= My reverse proxy is not working Make sure your proxy is passing the proper variables. At a minimum: X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto (X-Forwarded-Port if needed) You also need to Set the proxy or proxies as trusted If you are using a subdirectory on the reverse proxy and not on the actual web server, you may need to set APP_URL and $config['base_url'] . My alerts aren't being delivered on time If you're running MySQL/MariaDB on a separate machine or container make sure the timezone is set properly on both the LibreNMS and MySQL/MariaDB instance. Alerts will be delivered according to MySQL/MariaDB's time, so a mismatch between the two can cause alerts to be delivered late if LibreNMS is on a timezone later than MySQL/MariaDB. My alert templates stopped working You should probably have a look in the documentation concerning the new template syntax: https://docs.librenms.org/Alerting/Templates/ . Since version 1.42, syntax changed, and you basically need to convert your templates to this new syntax (including the titles). How do I use trend prediction in graphs As of Ver. 1.55 a new feature has been added where you can view a simple linear prediction in port graphs. It doesn't work on non-port graphs or consolidated graphs at the time this FAQ entry was written. To view a prediction: Click on any port graph of any network device Select a From date to your liking (not earlier than the device was actually added to LNMS), and then select a future date in the To field. Click update You should now see a linear prediction line on the graph. How do I move only the DB to another server? There is already a reference how to move your whole LNMS installation to another server. But the following steps will help you to split up an \"All-in-one\" installation to one LibreNMS installation with a seperate database install. *Note: This section assumes you have a MySQL/MariaDB instance Stop the apache and mysql service in you LibreNMS installation. Edit out all the cron entries in /etc/cron.d/librenms . Dump your librenms database on your current install by issuing mysqldump librenms -u root -p > librenms.sql . Stop and disable the MySQL server on your current install. On your new server make sure you create a new database with the standard install command, no need to add a user for localhost though. Copy this over to your new database server and import it with mysql -u root -p librenms < librenms.sql . Enter to mysql and add permissions with the following two commands: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON librenms.* TO 'librenms'@'IP_OF_YOUR_LNMS_SERVER' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD' WITH GRANT OPTION; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON librenms.* TO 'librenms'@'FQDN_OF_YOUR_LNMS_SERVER' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD' WITH GRANT OPTION; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; exit; Enable and restart MySQL server. Edit your config.php file to point the install to the new database server location. Very important : On your LibreNMS server, inside your install directory is a .env file, in it you need to edit the DBHOST paramater to point to your new server location. After all this is done, enable all the cron entries again and start apache.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"Support/FAQ/#getting-started","text":"How do I install LibreNMS? How do I add a device?

We have enabled support for setting a maximum value for rrd files for ports. Before this all rrd files were set to 100G max values, now you can enable support to limit this to the actual port speed. rrdtool tune will change the max value when the interface speed is detected as being changed (min value will be set for anything 10M or over) or when you run the included script (./scripts/tune_port.php) - see RRDTune doc SNMP ifInOctets and ifOutOctets are counters, which means they start at 0 (at device boot) and count up from there. LibreNMS records the value every 5 minutes and uses the difference between the previous value and the current value to calculate rate. (Also, this value resets to 0 when it hits the max value) Now, when the value is not recorded for awhile RRD (our time series storage) does not record a 0, it records the last value, otherwise, there would be even worse problems. Then finally we get the current ifIn/OutOctets value and record that. Now, it appears as though all of the traffic since it stopped getting values have occurred in the last 5 minute interval.

So here are some ways you can help LibreNMS improve. Code. This is a big thing. We want this community to grow by the software developing and evolving to cater for users needs. The biggest area that people can help make this happen is by providing code support. This doesn't necessarily mean contributing code for discovering a new device: Web UI, a new look and feel has been adopted but we are not finished by any stretch of the imagination. Make suggestions, find and fix bugs, update the design / layout. Poller / Discovery code. Improving it (we think a lot can be done to speed things up), adding new device support and updating old ones. The LibreNMS main website, this is hosted on GitHub like the main repo and we accept use contributions here as well :) Hardware. We don't physically need it but if we are to add device support, it's made a whole lot easier with access to the kit via SNMP. If you've got MIBs, they are handy as well :) If you know the vendor and can get permission to use logos that's also great. Bugs. Found one? We want to know about it. Most bugs are fixed after being spotted and reported by someone, I'd love to say we are amazing developers and will fix all bugs before you spot them but that's just not true. Feature requests. Can't code / won't code. No worries, chuck a feature request into our community forum with enough detail and someone will take a look. A lot of the time this might be what interests someone, they need the same feature or they just have time. Please be patient, everyone who contributes does so in their own time. Documentation. Documentation can always be improved and every little bit helps. Not all features are currently documented or documented well, there's speeling mistakes etc. It's very easy to submit updates through the GitHub website , no git experience needed. Be nice, this is the foundation of this project. We expect everyone to be nice. People will fall out, people will disagree but please do it so in a respectable way. Ask questions.

RRDCached MySQL Optimisation It's advisable after 24 hours of running MySQL that you run MySQL Tuner which will make suggestions on things you can change specific to your setup. One recommendation we can make is that you set the following in my.cnf under a [mysqld] group: innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 0 You can also set this to 2. This will have the possibility that you could lose up to 1 second on mysql data in the event MySQL crashes or your server does but it provides an amazing difference in IO use. Polling modules Review the graph of poller module time take under gear > pollers > performance to see what modules are consuming poller time. This data is shown per device under device > graphs > poller. Disable polling (and discovery) modules that you do not need. You can do this globally in config.php like: Disable OSPF polling $config [ 'poller_modules' ][ 'ospf' ] = false ; You can disable modules globally then re-enable the module per device or the opposite way. For a list of modules please see Poller modules SNMP Max Repeaters We have support for SNMP Max repeaters which can be handy on devices where we poll a lot of ports or bgp sessions for instance and where snmpwalk or snmpbulkwalk is used. This needs to be enabled on a per device basis under edit device -> snmp -> Max repeaters. You can also set this globally with the config option $config['snmp']['max_repeaters'] = X; . It's advisable to test the time taken to snmpwalk IF-MIB or something similar to work out what the best value is. To do this run the following but replace -REPEATERS- with varying numbers from 10 upto around 50. You will also need to set the correct snmp version, hostname and community string: time snmpbulkwalk -v2c -cpublic HOSTNAME -Cr-REPEATERS- -M /opt/librenms/mibs -m IF-MIB IfEntry NOTE: Do not go blindly setting this value as you can impact polling negatively. SNMP Max OIDs For sensors polling we now do bulk snmp gets to speed things up. By default this is ten but you can overwrite this per device under edit device -> snmp -> Max OIDs. You can also set this globally with the config option $config['snmp']['max_oid'] = X; . NOTE: It is advisable to monitor sensor polling when you change this to ensure you don't set the value too high. fping tuning You can change some of the default fping options used globally or per device. The defaults are: $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'timeout' ] = 500 ; $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'count' ] = 3 ; $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'interval' ] = 500 ; If your devices are slow to respond then you will need to increase the timeout value and potentially the interval value. However if your network is stable, you can increase poller performance by dropping the count value to 1 and/or the timeout+millsec value to 200 or 300: $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'timeout' ] = 300 ; $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'count' ] = 1 ; $config [ 'fping_options' ][ 'interval' ] = 300 ; This will mean that we no longer delay each icmp packet sent (we send 3 in total by default) by 0.5 seconds. With only 1 icmp packet being sent then we will receive a response quicker. The defaults mean it will take at least 1 second for a response no matter how quick the icmp packet is returned. Optimise poller-wrapper The default 16 threads that poller-wrapper.py runs as isn't necessarily the optimal number. A general rule of thumb is 2 threads per core but we suggest that you play around with lowering / increasing the number until you get the optimal value. Note KEEP in MIND that this doesn't always help, it depends on your system and CPU. So be careful. This can be changed by going to the cron job for librenms. Usually in /etc/cron.d/librenms and changing the \"16\" */5 * * * * librenms /opt/librenms/cronic /opt/librenms/poller-wrapper.py 16 Please also see Dispatcher Service Recursive DNS If your install uses hostnames for devices and you have quite a lot then it's advisable to setup a local recursive dns instance on the LibreNMS server. Something like pdns-recursor can be used and then configure /etc/resolv.conf to use 127.0.0.1 for queries. Per port polling - experimental By default the polling ports module will walk ifXEntry + some items from ifEntry regardless of the port. So if a port is marked as deleted because you don't want to see them or it's disabled then we still collect data. For the most part this is fine as the walks are quite quick. However for devices with a lot of ports and good % of those are either deleted or disabled then this approach isn't optimal. So to counter this you can enable 'selected port polling' per device within the edit device -> misc section or by globally enabling it ( not recommended ): $config['polling']['selected_ports'] = true; . This is truly not recommended, as it has been proven to affect cpu usage of your poller negatively. You can also set it for a specific OS: $config['os']['ios']['polling']['selected_ports'] = true; . Running ./scripts/collect-port-polling.php will poll your devices with both full and selective polling, display a table with the difference and optionally enable or disable selected ports polling for devices which would benefit from a change. Note that it doesn't continously re-evaluate this, it will only be updated when the script is run. There are a number of options: -h <device id> | <device hostname wildcard> Poll single device or wildcard hostname -e <percentage> Enable/disable selected ports polling for devices which would benefit <percentage> from a change If you want to run this script to have it set selected port polling on devices where a change of 10% or more is evaluated , run it with ./scripts/collect-port-polling.php -e 10 . But note: it will not blindly use only the 10%. There is a second condition that the change has to be more than one second in polling time. Web interface HTTP/2 If you are running https then you should enable http/2 support in whatever web server you use: For Nginx (1.9.5 and above) change listen 443 ssl; to listen 443 ssl http2; in the Virtualhost config. For Apache (2.4.17 an above) set Protocols h2 http/1.1 in the Virtualhost config. PHP-opcache A lot of performance can be gained from setting up php-opcache correctly. Note: Memory based caching with PHP cli will increase memory usage and slow things down. File based caching is not as fast as memory based and is more likely to have stale cache issues. Some distributions allow seperate cli, mod_php and php-fpm configurations, we can use this to set the optimal config. For web servers using mod_php and php-fpm Update your web PHP opcache.ini. Possible locations: /etc/php/7.2/fpm/conf.d/opcache.ini , /etc/php.d/opcache.ini , or /etc/php/conf.d/opcache.ini zend_extension=opcache opcache.enable=1 opcache.memory_consumption=256 If you are having caching issues, you can clear the opcache by simply restarting httpd or php-fpm. For pollers Create a cache directory that is writable by the librenms user first: sudo mkdir -p /tmp/cache && sudo chmod 775 /tmp/cache && sudo chown -R librenms /tmp/cache Update your PHP opcache.ini. Possible locations: /etc/php/7.2/cli/conf.d/opcache.ini , /etc/php.d/opcache.ini , or /etc/php/conf.d/opcache.ini zend_extension=opcache.so opcache.enable=1 opcache.enable_cli=1 opcache.file_cache=\"/tmp/cache/\" opcache.file_cache_only=0 opcache.file_cache_consistency_checks=1 opcache.memory_consumption=256 If you are having caching issues, you can clear the file based opcache with rm -rf /tmp/cache .","title":"Performance"},{"location":"Support/Performance/#performance-optimisations","text":"This document will give you some guidance on optimising your setup.

This will let you connect to devices on remote private IP ranges through one gateway on each site, routing them securely back to your LibreNMS installation. Configuring the monitoring server tinc should be available on nearly all Linux distributions via package management. If you are running something different, just take a look at tinc's homepage to find an appropriate version for your operating system: https://www.tinc-vpn.org/download/ I am going to describe the setup for Debian-based systems, but there are virtually no differences for e.g. CentOS or similar. First make sure your firewall accepts connections on port 655 UDP and TCP. Then install tinc via apt-get install tinc . Create the following directory structure to hold all your configuration files: mkdir -p /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts \"myvpn\" is your VPN network's name and can be chosen freely. Create your main configuration file: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc.conf Name = monitoring AddressFamily = ipv4 Device = /dev/net/tun Next we need network up- and down scripts to define a few network settings for inside our VPN: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-up #!/bin/sh ifconfig $INTERFACE 10 .6.1.1 netmask 255 .255.255.0 ip route add 10 .6.1.1/24 dev $INTERFACE ip route add 10 .0.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE ip route add 10 .100.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE ip route add 10 .200.0.0/22 dev $INTERFACE In this example we have 10.6.1.1 as the VPN IP address for the monitoring server on a /24 subnet. $INTERFACE will be automatically substituted with the name of the VPN, \"myvpn\" in this case. Then we have a route for the VPN subnet, so we can reach other sites via their VPN address. The last 3 lines designate the remote subnets. In the example I want to reach devices on three different remote private /22 subnets and be able to monitor devices on them from this server, so I set up routes for each of those remote sites in my tinc-up script. The tinc-down script is relatively simple as it just removes the custom interface, which should get rid of the routes as well: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-down #!/bin/sh ifconfig $INTERFACE down Make sure your scripts scan be executed: chmod +x /etc/tinc/myvpn/tinc-* As a last step we need a host configuration file. This should be named the same as the \"Name\" you defined in tinc.conf: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring Subnet = 10 .6.1.1/32 On the monitoring server we will just fill in the subnet and not define its external IP address to make sure it listens on all available external interfaces. It's time to use tinc to create our key-pair: tincd -n myvpn -K Now the file /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring should have an RSA public key appended to it and your private key should reside in /etc/tinc/myvpn/rsa_key.priv . To make sure that the connection will be restored after each reboot, you can add your VPN name to /etc/tinc/nets.boot . Now you can start tinc with tincd -n myvpn and it will listen for your remote sites to connect to it. Remote site configuration Essentially the same steps as for your central monitoring server apply for all remote gateway devices. These can be routers, or just any computer or VM running on the remote subnet, able to reach the internet with the ability to forward IP packets externally.

Copy over the monitoring server's host configuration (including the embedded public key) and add it's external IP address: vim /etc/tinc/myvpn/hosts/monitoring Address = 203 .0.113.6 Subnet = 10 .6.1.1/32 -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY----- VeDyaqhKd4o2Fz...

In my case I connected 3 remote sites running behind Ubiquiti EdgeRouters. Since those devices let me install software through Debian's package management it was very easy to set up. Just create the necessary configuration files and network scripts on each device and distribute the host configurations including the public keys to each device that will actively connect back. Now you can add all devices you want to monitor in LibreNMS using their internal IP address on the remote subnets or using some form of name resolution. I opted to declare the most important devices in my /etc/hosts file on the monitoring server.

The problem with this card is that the implementation is based on the final manufacturer of the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) and not based on a standard given by Carel. So each pCOweb card has a different configuration that needs a different MIB depending on the manufacturer implementation. The main problem is that LibreNMS will discover this card as pCOweb and not as your real manufacturer like it should. A solution was found to bypass this issue, but it's LibreNMS independent and you need to first configure your pCOWeb through the admin interface. Configuring the pCOweb card SNMP for LibreNMS First you need to configure your SNMP card using the admin interface. An SNMP tab in the configuration menu leaves you the choice to choose a System OID. This is a little tricky but based on this information we defined a \"standard\" for all implementation of Carel products with LibreNMS. The base Carel OID is 1.3.6.1.4.1.9839. To this OID we will add the final manufacturer Enterprise OID. You can find all enterprise OID following this link . This will allow us to create a specific support for this device.
